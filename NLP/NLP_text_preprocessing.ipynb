I\\r\\ncould fancy myself dead, and this Eternity!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes”--he reflected--“all men must feel it, for that conceit is helped\\r\\nout by the extraordinary stillness, the footfalls of man and bird and\\r\\nbeast are muffled, and the world seems empty. Nobody is stirring, for\\r\\nthere is nothing like a heavy fall of snow to keep people by their\\r\\nfiresides. Only the postman and the milkman go their rounds”; and while\\r\\nhe was dressing he heard their sudden knocks at the back door, with no\\r\\nwarning crunch of gravel, or sound of the gate slamming in the yard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Their fidelity,” he said to himself, “is like that of the clocks\\r\\nstriking the hours when there is death in the house”--for Mrs. Dunnock\\r\\nhad died exactly a year before, and her death was always in his mind.\\r\\nHis bedroom had been her bedroom, though only for a few months, for she\\r\\nhad died soon after her husband had been presented with a living, and\\r\\nsince her death he slept alone in the great bed where she had waited so\\r\\noften for him to come up from his study, and where he had always found\\r\\nher with her soft hair spread like a bird’s wing over the pillow, and\\r\\nin which she had died.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The clocks strike the hours in the moments of our greatest sorrow,” he\\r\\nsaid to himself. “Nothing will keep them from the punctual discharge\\r\\nof their duty, and listening to them we are recalled to this life,\\r\\nwe shoulder our burdens once more, we begin ticking again ourselves,\\r\\nticking away our ordinary lives.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to the looking-glass hanging over _her_ dressing-table and\\r\\nbegan to comb his beard, then, looking once more out of the window,\\r\\nwatched two men pass by, leading a horse along the road to be roughed\\r\\nat the blacksmith’s, a slow business, for one of the men had to throw\\r\\ndown sacks every few yards for it to step on, wherever the blizzard had\\r\\nwhirled away the snow and left a polished slide of ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a few minutes before nine he sat down to the breakfast table and\\r\\ntook the cup of tea that his daughter poured out for him; then, hearing\\r\\na shout, both Anne and he turned to the window and caught sight of a\\r\\nred muffler flying in the wind, and a thrown snowball, but when the\\r\\nchildren had passed, running on their way to school, all was silence,\\r\\nfor Mr. Dunnock had turned to read a circular which the postman had\\r\\nbrought that morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Evangelicals! Evangelicals!” he muttered angrily, for he was a\\r\\nritualist; a last flicker of the Oxford Movement had filled his life\\r\\nwith poetry. Then he pushed away the newspaper, and, taking some bread\\r\\nfor the birds, he rose from the breakfast table and went to the front\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world outside was dazzling, and the snow lay piled up deep before\\r\\nthe sill. Mr. Dunnock peered out, not daring to step in the snow in his\\r\\ncarpet slippers. He listened: not a sound; he looked and marked the\\r\\nroofs which yesterday were but the edges of a row of tiles, to-day as\\r\\nthick as thatch--like Christmas cards. “And here’s a robin,” he said,\\r\\n“waiting for me to throw him some of the bread.” He threw a piece which\\r\\nwas lost in the snow. “A wedding-cake! How strange it is to reflect\\r\\nthat Anne is older now than her mother when I married her! Yes, the\\r\\nworld is become a wedding-cake. Something very strange has happened,\\r\\nand who knows what will be the end of it? for it has begun to snow\\r\\nagain, and the rare flakes drift slowly to the ground like feathers\\r\\nfrom the angels’ wings. Are they moulting up there? Or has Satan got\\r\\namong them like a black cat which has climbed through the wire netting\\r\\ninto the dove loft?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dunnock fetched a piece of cardboard from his study to serve as a\\r\\ntable for the birds, and dropped it a few feet away on to the snow,\\r\\nthen, crumbling the bread in his fingers, he threw the birds their\\r\\nbreakfast. Some of the crumbs fell on each side into the snow and were\\r\\nlost.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here they come,” he said to himself, for bright eyes had been watching\\r\\nhim from every tree and bush.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe birds fluttered nearer, eyeing the crumbs spread out for them, and\\r\\nthen looking sideways at the tall, bearded man standing in the doorway.\\r\\nTheir fear was speedily forgotten, for the clergyman made it his habit\\r\\nto feed them every morning, and soon the cardboard table was covered\\r\\nwith sparrows, robins, blackbirds, and thrushes, all of them flashing\\r\\ntheir wings, bickering and scrambling for the finest crumbs like a\\r\\nflock of bantams. And having been successful, one would often fly off\\r\\nwith a piece in his bill, which he wished to devour in solitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne Dunnock remained at the breakfast table, for she had only just\\r\\nfinished the kipper on her plate. “The labourers will not go to work\\r\\nin the fields on such a day as this,” she said to herself. “And not\\r\\na woman will venture out except me, for women’s boots are generally\\r\\nleaky, and their skirts flap wet against their calves. With a frost\\r\\nlike this there should be skating, but the snow will have spoilt the\\r\\nice, even if it were swept.” She finished a piece of toast and rose\\r\\nfrom the table to clear away the breakfast. The loaf was a pitiful\\r\\nobject, only a shell of crust, with all of the inside scooped out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Another loaf gone,” she said to herself. “We always have stale crusts,\\r\\nyet I am sure the birds would eat them as readily as they do the crumb,\\r\\nand crusts are so nasty in bread-and-butter pudding.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dunnock continued watching the birds, and the draught from the open\\r\\nfront door made his daughter shiver. “Birds! Birds! I should like to\\r\\nwear a bird in my hat.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a tall girl, beautiful, with a small pale face, and\\r\\nstraw-coloured hair, hair which would not stay up; wherever she went\\r\\nshe scattered hairpins. She was still in mourning for her mother’s\\r\\ndeath, and her long black dress fitted her badly, hindering her\\r\\nimpatient movements, and giving her the look of a converted savage\\r\\ndressed in a missionary’s night-gown.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Father is feeding the birds. He never forgets them, and here am I\\r\\ngrudging them the crumb of the loaf. But housekeeping would have made\\r\\nSaint Francis uncharitable, though Saint Francis would not have said he\\r\\nwanted a bird for his hat.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marmalade, the cruet, the silver toast rack, all were put away into\\r\\nthe mahogany sideboard, the tablecloth was brushed, and holding the\\r\\nlittle wooden tray full of crumbs, she went out into the hall, where\\r\\nher father still stood at the open door, and then leaning over his\\r\\nshoulder she shook the crumbs out on to the snow, and, scared by her\\r\\nsudden gesture, the birds flew off.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Anne, how stupid and inconsiderate you are!” exclaimed her father,\\r\\nangrily. “How little imagination you have. Don’t you understand that\\r\\nwhen you wave anything suddenly like that you frighten them? There was\\r\\nsuch a fine missel-thrush too. He is not regular, and though the other\\r\\nbirds will soon come back, he will be discouraged. It is most vexing.”\\r\\nNow that Mr. Dunnock had lost his congregation (a far larger one than\\r\\nhad ever attended a Communion service at Dry Coulter Church), he shut\\r\\nthe door, shaking his head irritably, then he put his beard in his\\r\\nmouth, as if that were the best way to stifle his anger, and went into\\r\\nhis study.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book he took up fell from his hands before he had turned the second\\r\\nor third page, for he had not the intellect nor the determination to\\r\\nbe a scholar. A beautiful word always set his mind chasing a beautiful\\r\\npicture; his thoughts clouded over with dreams, and he remained lost in\\r\\nmeditation. When he came to himself it was to sink on to his knees in\\r\\nprayer, for he was a shy man, unable to express himself to men, and\\r\\nfor that reason much given to communing with God.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor twenty years he had been a poor curate at a church in the shadow\\r\\nof Ely Cathedral, but he had not been popular: he was indifferent to\\r\\nthe things which were important to his fellow clergy, and his mystical\\r\\nlove of ritual had found no sympathizers, until at last the Bishop took\\r\\npity on him, and gave him a small living in a district in the fens. His\\r\\ngrowing uncertainty of temper, combined with a sort of hopeless oddity,\\r\\nhad begun to make him a nuisance, and some provision had to be made.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Ely the Church is taken seriously: it is a great power, and on\\r\\ntaking up his new position, Mr. Dunnock was shocked to find it\\r\\ncompletely disregarded, for the inhabitants of Dry Coulter are\\r\\nNonconformists. Even with the few who belonged to the church, he was\\r\\nnot a success. His sermons were incomprehensible, yet they might have\\r\\npassed unnoticed if he had not affected a cassock and a biretta, if he\\r\\nhad not placed a crucifix on the Communion table and called a blessing\\r\\non the houses of the sick before he entered them. As vicar Mr. Dunnock\\r\\nwas a failure, and within less than a year he was regarded with far\\r\\ngreater contempt than is usually extended to the clergy. Yet he was\\r\\nnot a disappointed man, for he had never been ambitious of success,\\r\\nand had never imagined that he might be popular. He knew that it was\\r\\ntoo late in his life for him to make any effort; he was disinclined\\r\\nto exert himself with his parishioners, and avoiding them as far as\\r\\nhe could, he was not unhappy. He had grown lazy, too, and now that it\\r\\nwas in his power, he neglected to hold the innumerable little services\\r\\nwhich as a curate he had longed to celebrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf his wife had lived he might perhaps have exerted himself, but\\r\\nhe knew that Anne did not share his emotions, and soon the special\\r\\ndays were passed over, and Mr. Dunnock remained sunk in melancholy.\\r\\nSometimes his conscience pricked him; then he shut himself up in his\\r\\nroom and remained for hours in prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Damn the missel-thrush!” thought his daughter. “But father is always\\r\\nirritable on Mondays; I have noticed it before. Life indeed would be\\r\\nintolerable if it were not for the house. I have everything to make me\\r\\nunhappy, but I love this house. Dear old Noah’s ark.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went upstairs, where Maggie was waiting for her to help in making\\r\\nthe beds. Maggie Pattle was a girl of seventeen, who lived out with her\\r\\nmother, and let herself into the vicarage early every morning, for she\\r\\nwas the only servant and came in by the day. Shorter than Anne, she\\r\\nwas fully twice as broad, a well-nourished girl, who would eat a pound\\r\\nof sausages or of bacon at a sitting, washing it down with vinegar, and\\r\\nher red cheeks shone with health.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne often thought that if only Maggie had come from another village\\r\\nshe would have made an excellent servant; all her sluttish ways came\\r\\nfrom her mother’s being just round the corner; she had only to slip\\r\\ndown the vicarage garden and through a hole in the hedge to be at home.\\r\\nThe cottage was so small, and Mrs. Pattle and her family so large, that\\r\\nAnne thought of the old woman who lived in a shoe whenever she looked\\r\\nat it; though Mrs. Pattle never seemed in any doubt what to do. She\\r\\nknew when to slap a child, and when only to swear at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt she was a good mother, resembling very much one of the huge\\r\\nsows which sometimes wandered over the village green in front of her\\r\\ncottage--a sow whose steps were followed by a sounder of little porkers\\r\\ntrotting about in all directions. What if she did chastise one, or\\r\\neven gobble it up? One would not be missed.... No, indeed, for how did\\r\\nit come about that Mrs. Pattle had three children that all seemed to\\r\\nbe between two and three years old, yet none of them twins? Was one\\r\\nof them Maggie’s? Anne thought not, but it was difficult to be sure,\\r\\nand if the matter were not settled soon she would never know; on such\\r\\npoints the Pattles’ memories were not trustworthy. Yes, they were a\\r\\nslipshod family, though not exactly what one would call an immoral\\r\\none....\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, though Anne despised Maggie for her sluttishness and\\r\\nuntruthfulness, in some ways she admired her. Maggie was a good girl,\\r\\nshe did what she was told, had a passion for washing floors, and was\\r\\nnot a bad cook. Then she would go anywhere at any time, and do anything\\r\\nfor anybody to oblige. Mrs. Pattle’s cottage was crawling with babies,\\r\\ncould one of them be the fruit of this cheery good-nature?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if Anne admired the way Maggie scrubbed the scullery floor, she\\r\\nfelt envy when she saw her sauntering along the lanes with her hands in\\r\\nher pockets, whistling like a ploughboy, and stopping to speak to every\\r\\nperson she met on the road. Did she envy Maggie only because she had so\\r\\nmany friends, or was it partly because she knew all the boys and the\\r\\nyoung men, and went in the grove in the evenings, coming out with her\\r\\ncheeks no redder than they were by nature?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy was it, Anne asked herself, that she could not whistle as she\\r\\nwalked along in her long black dress and her black straw hat? She\\r\\nhad no friends to talk to except the village people, and she could\\r\\nonly visit them if they were ill, or in trouble. That, and watching\\r\\nher father feed the birds, was not enough to fill her life. She read,\\r\\nand when the young carters went ploughing she laid aside her book to\\r\\nwatch them as they passed the house, sitting sideways on their great\\r\\nhorses. Anne liked the way men whistled, and their deep voices as\\r\\nthey spoke to the cart-horses drinking at the pond, voices so full of\\r\\nrestraint and kindliness. There was no way for her to speak to these\\r\\nyoung men who looked so cheerful as they went by to work in their rough\\r\\nclothes, though sometimes, when she was out on a long walk and was far\\r\\nfrom home, she had tried to get into conversation with a young farmer\\r\\nleaning over a gate, or with a gamekeeper idling along the edge of a\\r\\nwood, his black and white spaniel at his heels.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the beds had to be made, and since she liked to sleep in a big\\r\\nfour-poster that they had found in the vicarage on their arrival, and\\r\\nher father also slept in a large bed, she helped Maggie to turn the\\r\\nmattresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt takes two to make a bed properly, and with an unselfish companion\\r\\nwho does not take more than her fair share of the sheets to tuck in on\\r\\nher side, it is pleasant work.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow the mattress bends and coils on itself, somersaulting heavily like\\r\\na whale, and how brave the great linen sheet looks as you turn it down!\\r\\nThe last of the two beds was made, and they were tucking in the quilt\\r\\nwhen a strange sound came from outside the house--a confused noise of\\r\\nvoices singing. Was it a hymn?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whatever can that be, Maggie?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s the carters come, Miss,” the girl answered. “It is Plough\\r\\nMonday to-day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is Plough Monday?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMaggie could only stare at this question--she could not answer it,\\r\\nexcept by saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, they always keep Plough Monday round here, though not properly,\\r\\nlike they used to do. They came to the gate last year, but I told them\\r\\nnot to come singing with your mother lying ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall go and see,” said Anne, and she ran across the landing\\r\\nfrom her bedroom, which faced the garden, into her father’s, which\\r\\noverlooked the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTWO: PLOUGH MONDAY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound of voices came again, men and boys singing, one out of tune\\r\\nwith the others, but all ringing with the same fresh gaiety and purity\\r\\nthrough the frosty air, reminding the hearer of the sharp notes of\\r\\nthe blacksmith’s hammer raining on the anvil, and giving him the same\\r\\nassurance that the very texture of man’s ordinary life is a beautiful\\r\\nand joyous fabric.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time Anne could hear the words of the song.\\r\\n\\r\\n  One morning very early,\\r\\n  The ploughboy he was seen\\r\\n  All hastening to the stable\\r\\n  His horses for to clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe ran to the window and, looking out into the whiteness, she was\\r\\nblinded for the first moment by the sun shining on to the dazzling\\r\\nfield of snow, but in the next instant she perceived three great\\r\\nchestnut horses standing just below her immediately in front of the\\r\\ndoor. They were harnessed to a plough, at the handles of which stood a\\r\\nlabourer, whilst at the head of each of the horses was a young carter,\\r\\nand on the foremost of the horses were two little boys riding. It was\\r\\nthe voices of these little boys which were so oddly out of tune.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was astonished to see them with their plough and horses so close\\r\\nto the doorstep, and was filled with a sense of strangeness even before\\r\\nshe saw what was most strange about these visitors. That a plough\\r\\nshould be standing so close to the house was strange, and even for the\\r\\nmoment seemed to her shocking, for one of the horses was standing on\\r\\na flower-bed, but this was nothing to the appearance of the men, for\\r\\nall of them had their faces blacked and their shoulders and their caps\\r\\nwere white with snow. The black faces against the whiteness of the snow\\r\\nfrightened her; for a moment she caught her breath with fear, which\\r\\nturned almost instantly to wonder and delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n  With chaff and corn\\r\\n  He did them bait,\\r\\n  Their tails and manes\\r\\n  He did comb straight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was it? What was it? Something strange, something beautiful, the\\r\\nthing perhaps she had always wanted, and half guessed at, but which\\r\\nshe had never before met face to face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tune changed:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Come all you lads and lasses\\r\\n  See a gay ploughboy.\\r\\n\\r\\nGay, yes, they were gay; the snow was falling, and the sun was shining,\\r\\nand they had blacked their faces and come to her doorstep, and one\\r\\nblack face with an open pink mouth was looking up at her in the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Please can you spare a halfpenny\\r\\n  For an old ploughboy?\\r\\n  A bit of bread and cheese\\r\\n  Is better than nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was over; one of the young carters came to the door and gave\\r\\na knock which echoed through the house. Anne started, woken from her\\r\\nrapt contemplation of the horses and the men, and still repeating under\\r\\nher breath: “Beautiful, they are beautiful!” she ran downstairs to open\\r\\nthe door. Mr. Dunnock, however, was there before her, and from the hall\\r\\nshe could see nothing of the men with their black faces, nor of the\\r\\nplough, nor the horses with their satin coats, their manes flecked with\\r\\nsnow, and their tails twisted up in plaits of straw; her father’s back\\r\\nblocked the doorway, and she could hear his voice in anger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s enough of this foolery. You should know better than to trample\\r\\ndown the lawn and the flower-bed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n  Give us a shilling and we shall be glad,\\r\\n  Give us a penny and we shall go home,\\r\\n\\r\\npiped the two little boys from the horse’s back. “Please, Sir, it’s\\r\\nPlough Monday, we like to keep it up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have nothing for you,” said her father. “I have quite enough\\r\\ndeserving objects for my charity.” He shut the door, and found himself\\r\\nface to face with his daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some village clod-hoppers have come begging,” said the clergyman,\\r\\nthrowing back his head and giving vent to a cough of irritation. “They\\r\\nactually brought three horses and a plough over the flower-beds and up\\r\\nto the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They won’t have hurt the flower-beds, father, in this weather, with so\\r\\nmuch snow on the ground,” said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps not,” he answered, “but they have made a great mess of the\\r\\nsnow in front of the house; besides I had wished to measure the\\r\\nfootprints of the birds.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You might have given them something, they seemed so jolly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Jolly?” Mr. Dunnock’s cough became almost a bark. “It is not my\\r\\nidea of jollity, nor I should have hoped yours, for yokels to black\\r\\ntheir faces in imitation of Christie minstrels, and come begging for\\r\\nmoney simply because they are given a day’s holiday on account of the\\r\\nweather.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, father, I think that it is an old custom, and that they expect to\\r\\nbe given money.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dunnock gazed at his daughter with real surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t hear of it. I most strongly disapprove. They may try other\\r\\npeople. I am not going to be victimized, or imposed on. Old custom?\\r\\nRemember what the midshipman said in his letter to his mother: ‘Manners\\r\\nthey have none, and their customs are beastly.’” The clergyman\\r\\nrecovered himself sufficiently to laugh at his own joke, but when his\\r\\ndaughter moved towards the door, he said angrily: “I forbid you to\\r\\nencourage them, Anne; the incident is closed and I have sent them away.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe local Christie minstrels, however, had not gone away, and as Mr.\\r\\nDunnock spoke a loud knock resounded on the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had better go upstairs, Anne. Kindly leave me to deal with them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne ran upstairs, trembling with rage, and rushed into her father’s\\r\\nbedroom, where, by looking out of window, she was able to see what was\\r\\ngoing on and overhear most of what was being said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Dunnock opened the door he found all the ploughmen gathered in\\r\\na group on the doorstep.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s Plough Monday, Sir, and we have come to keep it, and ask you for\\r\\na piece of money for our song.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have told you already to go away,” said the clergyman, coughing with\\r\\nexasperation. “I don’t give money to beggars.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a silence, then one of the young men at the back laughed\\r\\nand said: “He doesn’t tumble to it; tell the parson that it is Plough\\r\\nMonday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where would you be if there weren’t no ploughmen, or no ploughing\\r\\ndone?” asked the spokesman of the group. “You wouldn’t get no tithes if\\r\\nit weren’t for the plough.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a chorus of approval at that.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, that you wouldn’t!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He can’t answer that, Fred.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey shouted, but at the word _tithes_ Mr. Dunnock had slammed the\\r\\ndoor in their faces. The ploughmen knocked again, and for some minutes\\r\\nthe sound echoed through every room in the house. Anne could see that\\r\\nthey were puzzled, and in some doubt what to do next. One or two of\\r\\nthem were laughing, another scratched his head while he said: “Called\\r\\nus beggars, did he? Reckon we work as hard as he.” Presently they\\r\\nretreated to one corner of the garden and remained talking together for\\r\\nsome little while, until Maggie appeared from round the corner of the\\r\\nkitchen and called out to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had best go away,” she said. “The parson he says you are a lot\\r\\nof lazy louts. I heard him. He won’t give you naught. You won’t get\\r\\nnothing if you do plough his doorstep up.” The ploughmen did not answer\\r\\nher, nor did they appear to pay any attention to her words, but slowly\\r\\nwent back to their horses’ heads. “What must be, must be,” said the\\r\\noldest of the company, laying hold of the handles of the plough. “I’ld\\r\\nas lief keep the custom. Come on, boys!” he shouted. At these words\\r\\nAnne could see that they all suddenly recovered their good humour, and\\r\\na moment after they began joking among themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Parson will have to wipe his feet on his mat before we have done with\\r\\nhim,” said one lad.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There won’t be anyone shy of paying us our pennies after this,” added\\r\\nanother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let him preach what sermon he likes next Sunday; there won’t be no one\\r\\nbut his daughter and our Maggie to hear him swearing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey, my beauties!” shouted the ploughman at the handles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great horses strained and began to move; the young carters at their\\r\\nheads shouted and led the team in a wide circle across the untouched\\r\\nsnowfield which was the lawn; the plough sidled and circled through the\\r\\nsnow, and the men began arguing with the horses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hold back, can’t you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Steady there, whoa.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, after one horse had nearly put its head through the window of\\r\\nMr. Dunnock’s study, and another had trampled down a rose bush, the\\r\\nplough was got into position at the far corner of the house. After\\r\\nthat they all waited while the ploughman left the handles and began to\\r\\nhammer at part of his plough.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fear which Anne had felt when she first looked out returned to her,\\r\\nand the sense of strangeness persisted. Was she waking or dreaming, was\\r\\nshe afraid or was she glad? Suddenly she heard Maggie’s voice saying in\\r\\nexcited tones:\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are never going to plough up Mr. Dunnock’s doorstep!” and hearing\\r\\nthese words Anne began to tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the ploughman straightened his back and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Calls us idle beggars, does he? And too busy to speak with us; we’ll\\r\\nmark Plough Monday in his prayer-book. Get up there....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horses strained, and the plough sank through the snow into the\\r\\nsoft earth of a flower-bed, the traces tightened and the three horses\\r\\npulled; a wrinkle or two showed itself in their haunches, and the share\\r\\nof the plough threw up a broad streak of raw earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Steady, boys, steady by the doorstep,” called the ploughman, and the\\r\\ncarters edged the horses nearer in to the wall of the house. In a\\r\\nmoment the plough reached the door, and Anne, gazing down from above,\\r\\nsaw the flagstone lift and topple, while the plough ran swiftly on, and\\r\\nthe earth streamed out upon the snow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must stop them,” she whispered, but she did not move, or take her\\r\\neyes off the scene. Watching from above, the girl was fascinated\\r\\nand horrified by every detail; the swift and irresistible progress\\r\\nof the hidden ploughshare running through the earth delighted her;\\r\\nthe strength of the three stalwart Suffolk Punches, and the lean,\\r\\nsinewy wrists of the ploughman guiding the handles, and the gay young\\r\\nmen, all thrilled her. While watching, she could not have told what\\r\\nwere her emotions: yet she knew that the scene was beautiful, the\\r\\nplough slipping so easily in the rich earth had the grace and lissom\\r\\nstrength of a snake. Once again the horses turned, sweeping down and\\r\\nhalting beside the hedge of laurel, and there was another pause while\\r\\nthe plough was got into position, and then the team swept round and\\r\\nstrained forward again to cut the second furrow, and, that finished, to\\r\\ndraw the plough out into the roadway in front of the vicarage, while\\r\\nthe ploughman threw the handles on one side and held them down so that\\r\\nthe share skidded through the snow over the grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men did not call out, nor even appear to speak or to laugh among\\r\\nthemselves; having cut their two furrows, they went away swiftly,\\r\\npausing only for a moment on the road to adjust the ploughshare, and\\r\\nthen hurrying on to sing their songs under other windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly when the plough had turned the corner of the lane and the last\\r\\nof the horses’ heads had vanished down the avenue of elm trees, did\\r\\nAnne Dunnock leave her position at the window, and only then did she\\r\\nburst into a flood of tears. “I cannot live after such an insult,”\\r\\nshe said to herself. “How could they do such a thing to our house? But\\r\\nwhy is it that it seemed to me so beautiful as well as so cruel?” and\\r\\nas she asked herself this question she noticed that though she had\\r\\ndried her tears her hands were still trembling. “The lawn of virgin\\r\\nsnow has been torn up by the plough, the naked earth exposed, and the\\r\\ngarden trampled over by the iron shoes of the horses and the hobnails\\r\\nof the labourers,” she said. “And our doorstep has been overturned; my\\r\\nfather’s fault, for he was in the wrong. I feel now as if I could never\\r\\nforgive him for bringing this shame on us, yet if it had not been him\\r\\nit might have been me, for the same fault of character is in both of\\r\\nus. We are rejected everywhere, unable to share in the life around us,\\r\\nor to understand it. Enid taught me that at Ely, but to-day it has been\\r\\nrecognized by the ploughmen, and this broad gash in the earth and the\\r\\nuprooted doorstep proclaim it to our neighbours. I shall never dare\\r\\nshow my face in the village after this.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, Anne Dunnock found herself sobbing again. “This is too\\r\\nsilly,” she told herself, yet the tears continued to flow, until she\\r\\ngave up resisting them and lay down on the bed in her own room. She\\r\\nthought of Enid, to whom she had written so many poems and so many\\r\\npassionate letters, only to discover that they had been shown to all\\r\\nthe girls in the school, that they had been borrowed and read aloud in\\r\\nevery bathroom where there were girls talking before going to bed. “I\\r\\ncould have killed Enid; she made all the girls in Ely think that I was\\r\\nperfectly ridiculous.” And all the bitter experiences of her life came\\r\\nback into her mind and were confused with her present unhappiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why should we suffer from this?” she asked herself, after a few\\r\\nmoments of weeping. “For I know father suffers from it as much as I\\r\\ndo, though he has never spoken of it to me, and perhaps not even to\\r\\nhimself. Is it because he is a clergyman, or is it because we are in\\r\\nsome way superior, cleverer, or better than our neighbours? No,” she\\r\\nanswered herself, “it cannot be that, for though I am intelligent,\\r\\nperhaps even remarkably intelligent, father is terribly stupid. In fact\\r\\nhe is almost deficient in some respects, and I am sure neither he nor I\\r\\nare superior morally. We are both too emotional and too ready to lose\\r\\nour tempers. All our troubles spring from the fact that father is a\\r\\nclergyman, for whether they recognize it or not, ordinary people have\\r\\na contempt for the clergy, and clergymen are always ill at ease with\\r\\ntheir fellow men. Thank God father isn’t one of the hearty sort; in\\r\\nhis own way he is an honest man and a religious one, but he has ruined\\r\\nmy life. It is Ibsen’s _Ghosts_ over again,” for Anne had been reading\\r\\nIbsen lately. Then a phrase from another book she had been reading, De\\r\\nQuincey’s _Opium-eater_, came into her mind: “Unwinding the accursed\\r\\nchain.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can I unwind the accursed chain?” she asked herself. “I must begin\\r\\nsoon, for I am twenty-three, and the best part of my life is gone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is no good crying over spilt milk,” she said, and went on: “At all\\r\\nevents I am glad that they did not go away when father told them to\\r\\ngo; I am glad that they tore up our garden with that narrow snake-like\\r\\nplough wobbling a little as it ran through the earth. I am glad of it,\\r\\nthough I shall find it hard to face our neighbours after this, for they\\r\\nwill have changed. Everyone will know of our disgrace.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose from her bed and tidied her hair before the glass; as usual\\r\\nall the hairpins had fallen. Then turning to the window she looked out\\r\\nover the untouched snowfield at the back of the house where not even a\\r\\ndog had run as yet. Everything was covered, even the winter jessamine\\r\\non the summer-house was concealed, and the black poplars beyond the\\r\\npond had every twig laden with snow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All will be forgotten as soon as the snows are melted,” she said to\\r\\nherself suddenly, with the certainty that her words were true. “All my\\r\\nemotion is nonsense. To me everything seems changed, but it is only\\r\\na joke to the carters; they will laugh about it over a pint of beer\\r\\nto-day, but in a week’s time they will have forgotten it; the fact that\\r\\nsome dog has killed a rat will seem more important. My life is not\\r\\nchanged: to-morrow the mason will come to lay the doorstep in its old\\r\\nplace, and I shall say: ‘It’s a fine day,’ when I go to the grocer’s\\r\\nshop, and: ‘Very seasonable weather,’ when I take the loaves from the\\r\\nbaker. That is the nearest that I shall ever get to contact with my\\r\\nfellows; why should they care how we live, what we do, or whether we\\r\\ndisgrace ourselves or not? We mean nothing to them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Anne Dunnock, who only a few moments before had been weeping\\r\\nbecause the world was changed, began suddenly to weep again because it\\r\\nappeared to her that it had not changed and that it would always remain\\r\\nthe same. This time the tears were not so readily checked, for one tear\\r\\nbrings the next after it, and Anne remained hidden in her bedroom until\\r\\nMaggie knocked at the door to say that lunch was on the table. But by\\r\\nthen she herself had forgotten what had so much moved her less than\\r\\ntwo hours before, for she had taken up _Peer Gynt_, and as she went\\r\\ndownstairs she was thinking not of the carters with their black faces\\r\\nand the snow on their caps, but of the trolls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHREE: SOTHEBY’S SHOP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the night the wind changed to the west and rain fell, so that by\\r\\nmorning the snow was gone from the grass, and only lingered in a few\\r\\nplaces, on the roads and on the bare earth of the kitchen garden,\\r\\nand the rain which thawed the snow washed away the memory of Plough\\r\\nMonday, thus bringing to pass what Anne had fancied sooner than she had\\r\\nexpected.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe no longer felt ashamed to go into the village, and as for her\\r\\nfather, half an hour after the event he had forgotten his irritation in\\r\\nwatching the starlings searching for worms in the loose earth thrown up\\r\\nby the plough.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breakfast, old Noah, the gardener, busied himself in filling in\\r\\nthe furrow, and old Simmonds, who called himself a builder and fencing\\r\\ncontractor, came round and, after mixing a little mortar on a board,\\r\\nlaid the doorstep back, only a trifle askew, in its old place.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s your doorstep, Miss,” he said, straightening his back as Anne\\r\\nopened the front door and stood on the threshold prepared for walking.\\r\\n“There’s your doorstep; no one will ever shift that again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSimmonds was right, for Anne lacked the courage to tell him to take it\\r\\nup and set it straight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“May I step on it?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ay, he’ll bear your weight, Miss,” said the old man blinking, and to\\r\\nprove his words he stepped on to the doorstep himself, blocking her\\r\\npath while he stamped once or twice with his hobnailed boots.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that firm enough for you, Miss?” he asked, speaking with melancholy\\r\\npride, and then standing aside for her to walk on it herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, that seems all right, Simmonds,” she said, stepping on to the\\r\\nstone, and was aware as she spoke that her words were meaningless, for\\r\\nwhy should the old man be so proud of the force of gravity which kept\\r\\nthe doorstep where it lay? Why should she have to give him credit for\\r\\nit?\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was going to speak to your father, Miss, about the sills,” said\\r\\nSimmonds.\\r\\n\\r\\n“About what?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a long time since they were painted, and the wood is perishing. I\\r\\nthought perhaps your father might like me to estimate for them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne frowned; the question of the sills annoyed her, but she could not\\r\\nescape until she had looked at them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimmonds was right--the paint on the window-sills had cracked into\\r\\nhundreds of little grey lichenous cups.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll speak to him about it,” she said. “We must have it done one day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elm trees were so beautiful; it was because of the elms that she\\r\\nloved Dry Coulter. Soon the spring would come, soon the snowdrops would\\r\\ncluster thickly under the garden walls, and every day that passed\\r\\nimproved the quality of the birds’ song.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is no prison so terrible as beauty,” she said suddenly to\\r\\nherself. “I love the seasons, the beauty of the village, the clouds,\\r\\nand the tall groves of elms standing round the green. I love our\\r\\norchard with its old apple trees, and the pears; I dream in the winter\\r\\nof what the crop will be in the following autumn, fearing that the\\r\\nbullfinches will take the buds, or the blossom be cut down by a late\\r\\nfrost, yet time is flying--and while my blood runs fast as it does now\\r\\nI must walk demurely like the old woman that I shall so soon become.\\r\\nYes, I shall be old before I am free to live as I should like. Shall\\r\\nI ever go to the opera? A cheap seat would do--I cannot expect a box,\\r\\nor emeralds, but one can hear as well from the gallery, and it is\\r\\nthe music that I want to hear. Shall I escape one day? Shall I go to\\r\\nLondon?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it came into her mind that perhaps even if she went to London,\\r\\neven if she got to know interesting men (and such beings must exist),\\r\\neven if she went to the opera with them, she might still feel herself\\r\\na prisoner, and that perhaps the most that one can do in life is to\\r\\nexchange one sort of beauty for another; the beauty of the apple trees\\r\\nfor the beauty of music.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, there is no prison so terrible as beauty,” she said again, and\\r\\nadded immediately: “Now I must go to the grocer’s,” and though she\\r\\ndisliked the grocer himself, she smiled with pleasure at the thought\\r\\nthat she might see his little daughter Rachel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Emmanuel Sotheby, Grocer and Provision Merchant_” was painted over\\r\\nthe little shop with its windows filled with bars of soap, packets of\\r\\nstarch, clay pipes, and walnuts, for Sotheby dealt in everything, and\\r\\nthough the shop was small, the stock was large. Sotheby always had\\r\\nwhat you wanted: calico, mustard, cotton, China tea, boot polish, even\\r\\nlamp chimneys. There was no shop so good as Sotheby’s in the nearest\\r\\ntown: there was nothing better than Sotheby’s even in Ely, yet would\\r\\nhe be able to provide her with drawing-pins? It was unlikely, almost\\r\\nimpossible, and Anne determined not to mention them until she had made\\r\\nher other purchases; she would only speak of them just before she left\\r\\nthe shop. In that way Mr. Sotheby would not feel that she had expected\\r\\ntoo much of him, or think that she was disappointed. With her hand on\\r\\nthe latch, she said to herself: “I will not speak of the drawing-pins\\r\\nif there are other customers,” but the shop was empty, and the jangling\\r\\nbell brought Mrs. Sotheby out of an inner room. The grocer’s wife was\\r\\na slender woman of fifty; her pale wrinkled face made her seem older,\\r\\nthough her hair was still a beautiful brown, and when she smiled she\\r\\nshowed two even rows of little pearly teeth. Mrs. Sotheby was always\\r\\nmerry; whenever Anne came into the shop her brown eyes twinkled, or\\r\\nshe broke into a low musical laugh, while her face crumpled itself up\\r\\ninto all its wrinkles, her white teeth flashed, and her eyes almost\\r\\nvanished. Such a merry laugh greeted Anne that morning, and Mrs.\\r\\nSotheby explained it by a reference to the events of the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good morning, Miss Dunnock, I have been hearing such dreadful things\\r\\nall yesterday about the ploughmen. I am afraid they must have upset\\r\\nyour father, but you must not take any notice of them. It is all\\r\\nfoolishness, and I don’t know what the men can have been thinking of,\\r\\nbut, of course, it is an old custom and they like keeping it on that\\r\\naccount. You know men are just like boys about anything like that, but\\r\\nthey did not mean to be disrespectful or unneighbourly, I’m sure. Your\\r\\nfather is still rather a stranger here; I expect he did not understand\\r\\ntheir ways.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Mrs. Sotheby’s words Anne started, all her shame came back to her\\r\\nsuddenly, but she saw that she must answer. A lump came in her throat,\\r\\nand her mouth trembled as she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, neither father nor I had ever heard of Plough Monday. It was\\r\\nentirely my father’s fault: he is sometimes impatient when he is\\r\\ndisturbed reading.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was very foolish of the men,” said Mrs. Sotheby. “And they should\\r\\nfeel ashamed of themselves, but directly I heard of it I knew there was\\r\\na misunderstanding of some sort. It happens so easily, only I thought\\r\\nI would speak of it, because you know it is an old custom, and the men\\r\\nare proud of keeping it here, so you must make allowances for them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kindliness of these words was more than Anne could bear. “Thank\\r\\nyou, thank you so much,” she cried, and suddenly she found that her\\r\\ntears would flow--she could not keep them back, though she shook her\\r\\nhead angrily, and as she did so a couple of hairpins dropped on to the\\r\\nfloor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment a shadow passed in front of the windows; there was the\\r\\nsound of wheels, and a horse being pulled up short in front of the shop.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne looked about her wildly, but Mrs. Sotheby had lifted a flap of the\\r\\ncounter and was saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come into our parlour and sit down for a little while, Miss Dunnock;\\r\\nit was foolish of me to speak, but I never guessed you would have taken\\r\\nsuch nonsense to heart. If one were to pay attention to half the silly\\r\\nthings men do, our lives would not be worth living.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne followed Mrs. Sotheby through the shop into a little room, with\\r\\na coal fire burning in the grate. She sat down in the armchair pushed\\r\\nforward for her, while the grocer’s wife hurried back into the shop,\\r\\nsummoned by the jangling bell. For a little while Anne was overcome\\r\\nwith mortification at finding herself in the grocer’s parlour and\\r\\nwondered how she could have so disgraced herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, if she must cry every morning (and it seemed to have become a\\r\\nhabit), could she not retire to her own room and weep in solitude?\\r\\nBut after a few moments of humiliation the thought came into her mind\\r\\nthat at last she had disgraced herself finally and for ever, and this\\r\\nreflection was a consolation to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot undo this. If I were to steal out of the back door without\\r\\nMrs. Sotheby hearing me, it would make no difference. I have shown her\\r\\nmy feelings; I have burst into tears in her shop; I cannot pretend to\\r\\nhave any dignity after this.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne dried the last of her tears, reflecting that it was exciting\\r\\nto have made a fool of herself, and that if she had not lost her\\r\\nself-control she would never have been asked into that parlour. Then,\\r\\ntaking off her hat, she began tidying her hair and looking about her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room she was in was small and richly furnished with uncomfortable\\r\\narmchairs, upholstered in dark red plush; there was a table covered\\r\\nwith a red cloth, which had a fringe of little balls; a slowly\\r\\nticking clock stood on the mantelpiece; on a small table, before the\\r\\nwindow, stood a large green pot containing an arum lily with one leaf\\r\\nhalf-unfurled and a white bud showing; from the curtain rod hung a wire\\r\\ncage full of maidenhair ferns. On the walls were photographs: Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Sotheby on their wedding day, a plump and rather ugly young woman,\\r\\nthe Tower Bridge with a ship going through it, and a boy with pomatum\\r\\non his hair. Then, turning her head, Anne saw a large photograph\\r\\nhanging just behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a strange face!” for the young man certainly had a strange face,\\r\\nand was wearing an odd little round cap, almost like a skull-cap, with\\r\\na tiny tail sticking up in the middle; his throat was bare, with no\\r\\nsign of a collar or tie, or even of a shirt. A cigarette was hanging\\r\\nout of the corner of his mouth, but the strangest thing was not the\\r\\ncap, but the face, or rather the expression of the face, for the\\r\\nfeatures themselves were vaguely familiar. The young man was laughing,\\r\\nbut there was a look of careless contempt, almost of insolence, which\\r\\nAnne very much disliked. The nose was long and straight, and rather\\r\\nfoxy, the eyes mere slits set wide apart; the forehead was broad\\r\\nand large, but the chin feeble. “Good gracious me!” exclaimed Anne,\\r\\nnoticing that in one ear there was a little earring. “A man wearing\\r\\nan earring! How extraordinary!” She gazed at the photograph for some\\r\\ntime, taking in every detail of the face. Certainly there was something\\r\\ndisagreeable in the expression; the laughter was untrustworthy and\\r\\nheartless; he was laughing at other people, not sharing his laughter\\r\\nwith them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the customer was staying a long while in the shop, and, becoming\\r\\nimpatient, she went to the door and listened. The voice she heard was\\r\\nthat of Mr. Lambert, a young farmer, whom Anne knew since he attended\\r\\nchurch (he was a churchwarden), and once he had stopped her in the road\\r\\nand told her that she should go riding.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Anne his remark had seemed ridiculous, since he must know well\\r\\nenough that they were too poor to keep a hack for her use, and he could\\r\\nnot have meant that he had one for her to ride.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he had wished to say: “If you get the habit, I’ll mount you on one\\r\\nof my horses,” why hadn’t he said so? He could not have intended that,\\r\\nand even if he had, what would she have answered? What did he expect in\\r\\nreturn? That she should go riding with him? She smiled at the thought:\\r\\nMr. Lambert’s company might not be so bad, but she would not care for\\r\\nit if she were under an obligation to him. If she killed his horse in\\r\\ntaking a fence ... that would be awkward! And if he met a girl whom he\\r\\nliked better as a companion on his rides--in that case she would be\\r\\nleft with the habit on her hands. Her father would never allow such a\\r\\nthing; think of the gossip there would be!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Damn this place! Damn my father!” she said to herself, and listening\\r\\nto the farmer’s sharp, but very pleasant voice, and closing her eyes,\\r\\nshe had for a moment the delicious sensation of the horse bounding\\r\\nunder her, of patting its withers, listening to the creak of the\\r\\nsaddle, and keeping her balance while she looked proudly over the level\\r\\nlandscape of the fens.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will, I will, I will,” she repeated to herself. “I will ride a\\r\\nhorse once in my life. I will even if I get left with a riding habit.\\r\\nBut I suppose that is the spirit which brings young girls to ruin.\\r\\nI can imagine how Maggie would say to herself: ‘I will let my head\\r\\nbe turned by a man, even if I am left with a baby.’” Anne laughed at\\r\\nthe comparison. “Silly thoughts.... They hurry me on to absurdities,\\r\\nand all because Mr. Lambert said something polite and meaningless to\\r\\nme, for it is politeness to assume that one can do whatever one likes\\r\\nwithout regard for money. But here am I laughing when I ought still\\r\\nto be sobbing, since I am still waiting for Mrs. Sotheby to come and\\r\\nconsole me. What shall I do? How on earth, by what false pretences, did\\r\\nI ever get into this cosy little room? If Mr. Lambert does not go away\\r\\nsoon, I shall march into the shop, lift the flap in the counter and go\\r\\naway.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe listened then to the voices. “Very good, Mrs. Sotheby, you shall\\r\\nhave the pig for scalding on Thursday, unless Mr. Sotheby sends me word\\r\\nto-morrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bell of the shop tinkled; Mr. Lambert paused to add a last word,\\r\\nand Mrs. Sotheby answered him: “Well, if you say so, Mr. Lambert,” and\\r\\nAnne could hear her hand on the latch.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I thought Mr. Lambert was never going. He had come to see Mr.\\r\\nSotheby about carting sand, and really I didn’t know what to say to\\r\\nhim. Now I have agreed to share a pig with him; let me know if you\\r\\nwould like a leg of pork, or sausages, or one of my pork cheeses. My\\r\\nhusband is so busy now; I hardly see him from morning till night; he is\\r\\nputting up some cottages at Linton, and his mind is far more on them\\r\\nthan on the grocery business, so that I have quite as much as I can\\r\\nmanage. I am really sorry that I undertook to scald the pig, but it\\r\\nwas rather tempting. Still, however many pigs I scald, I shall never\\r\\ndo half so much as Emmanuel does; he’s out every day of the week, and\\r\\ndrives the round himself, and then he preaches twice every Sunday,\\r\\nhere and in the Ebenezer Tabernacle at Wet Coulter. Mr. Lambert wanted\\r\\nto see him in a hurry, but I could not tell him where to find my\\r\\nhusband. I cannot keep in my head half the things he is doing, and I\\r\\nhave not yet been out to see the Linton cottages. Still, it keeps him\\r\\nin good spirits, and he is doing it for my boy. But I mustn’t keep you\\r\\nany longer now.” Mrs. Sotheby stopped speaking, she smiled, and added\\r\\nrather shyly: “You will come and chat with me sometimes, won’t you,\\r\\nMiss Dunnock?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne promised to come again soon, and spoke of the arum lily beginning\\r\\nto unfold its flower, and then, passing through into the shop, asked\\r\\nfor curry powder and sultanas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen these had been given her, she hesitated, asking herself whether,\\r\\nafter Mrs. Sotheby’s kindness, she could ask for drawing-pins. Perhaps\\r\\nMr. Sotheby would fetch some from Linton, but at that moment she felt\\r\\nshy of asking a man who was building a row of cottages to execute her\\r\\nlittle commissions. She would wait until another day for that. But on\\r\\nthe doorstep she paused:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you for being so kind to me. I shall always come and talk to you\\r\\nif I am upset by anything.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe face behind the counter broke into hundreds of wrinkles, the little\\r\\nteeth shone, and a delighted laugh answered her. “Like pouring water\\r\\nout of a glass bottle,” thought Anne as she went out into the winter\\r\\nsunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was happiness, who could doubt it? The secret of life was to\\r\\nbe like the Sothebys, and to work as they did, absorbed in building\\r\\ncottages. Would she ever think the prospect of scalding a pig too\\r\\ntempting to be refused, if she were over-worked already?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Sotheby must be very enterprising,” she said to herself, trying\\r\\nto conquer her dislike for him, and forgot the grocer in gazing at the\\r\\ndistant elms which bounded the far side of the village green a quarter\\r\\nof a mile away, for in the middle of the village was a long and lovely\\r\\nstretch of common pasture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut who was the boy for whom Mr. Sotheby worked so hard? And Anne\\r\\nremembered that Maggie Pattle had once told her that the Sothebys had a\\r\\nson. Why was it that she had imagined that he was dead? But it did not\\r\\noccur to her to connect him with the photograph in the parlour, for she\\r\\nwas looking at the elm trees, and listening to the song of a thrush;\\r\\nthen gazing at the roof of Lambert’s barn, bathed in sunlight, she felt\\r\\nher heart beating happily, and asked herself why had she felt beauty\\r\\nwas a prison? She could be happy in that village for ever, for spring\\r\\nwas coming, and the birds were singing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOUR: THE TRAPEZE BOY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA hard frost came early in February.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If this lasts,” said Mr. Dunnock eagerly, “we shall have skating the\\r\\nday after to-morrow,” but his face clouded quickly, and he put down\\r\\nhis cup with a gesture of annoyance. The day after to-morrow would be\\r\\nSunday.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We may be in for a long spell of frost,” said Anne, but, reminded of\\r\\nhis duties, her father was not in the mood to be consoled. “A frost\\r\\nbrings more suffering than you or I can quite realize, my dear,” he\\r\\nsaid severely. “Think of the poor, without the coal or the blankets to\\r\\nkeep them warm; think of the seamen in the rigging of ships; think of\\r\\nthe outcasts on the roads; think of the birds.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Think of the polar bears,” said Anne under her breath, as her father\\r\\nrose from the table and scooped out the crumb of the loaf.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The trap ought to be here in ten minutes; I shall be back from Ely\\r\\nby the eight o’clock train,” he said, and with these words went to\\r\\nthe front door where an impatient flock of sparrows was waiting his\\r\\narrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the trap came, she went to the gate and watched her father drive\\r\\naway, wondering whether he would meet Enid in the street. “I am glad I\\r\\nam not going. Now the rest of the day is mine. Mine, and I am free to\\r\\ndo whatever I choose!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road was like iron; it rang under the pony’s hoofs, and Anne\\r\\nthought she had never seen a lovelier morning; the spell of the frost\\r\\nwas more beautiful than the enchanted world of the snow had been a\\r\\nmonth before, though it was not so strange. Every twig was fledged with\\r\\nrime, for there had been a fog during the night, but already the sun\\r\\nhad broken through the mist, the sky was showing blue overhead, and the\\r\\nwhite tops of the elms were blushing in the sunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Every tree is smothered in snowy blossom; it is as if spring had\\r\\ncome,” and she thought that the flowering time of the cherry in Japan\\r\\ncould not equal the beauty of this February morning in England. When\\r\\nshe turned to go back into the house she noticed that the bare wall of\\r\\nthe vicarage was covered with hoarfrost, an opalescent bloom shining in\\r\\nthe sunlight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A fairy palace fit for the Snow Queen or the Sleeping Beauty,” she\\r\\nsaid, and the words reminded her that Maggie must be waiting for her to\\r\\nmake the beds.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You ought to see the fat woman,” said Maggie Pattle. “Her bosom was\\r\\nbigger than that pair of marrows Mr. Lambert gave for Harvest Festival;\\r\\nthere’s a paper outside says she is only twenty and weighs nineteen\\r\\nstone. I shall never call Ida Whalley fat again, after last night.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLinton Fair lasted two days, and the merry-go-rounds were staying till\\r\\nthe end of the week.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I went in the swing-boats, and I went to the circus, and I spent seven\\r\\nshillings altogether,” said Maggie with triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne shuddered at the fat woman, but when Maggie spoke of the circus,\\r\\nof the little lady who rode on a pink horse and jumped through paper\\r\\nhoops, and of a horse that undressed and went to bed and drew up the\\r\\nsheets with its teeth, she wished that she could go herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why not? Why not?” she wondered. “Why should I not go this afternoon?\\r\\nThere is no disgrace in going to the fair, and there are the\\r\\ndrawing-pins that I have to buy at Linton. I must begin trying to do\\r\\nsome fashion plates. Besides, I should enjoy the walk on a day like\\r\\nthis.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe six miles of road brought a glow of colour into her cheeks, and she\\r\\nfelt her heart beat with excitement as she crossed the old bridge over\\r\\nthe Ouse, and entered the little town. The streets were crowded with\\r\\nmen and beasts; the market place was full of farmers and machinery,\\r\\nand half a dozen cheap-jacks, each surrounded by a dense crowd, were\\r\\nshouting against each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne quickened her pace; the noise of a steam organ told her that the\\r\\nmerry-go-rounds were in a field near the railway station, but when she\\r\\nhad passed the first booths, the coco-nut shies, the rifle-range, and\\r\\nthe places where she was invited to win cups and saucers by throwing\\r\\nrings, she suddenly became embarrassed. Just in front of her were the\\r\\nswing-boats sure enough, laden with shrieking girls; beyond them a\\r\\ngreat merry-go-round painted with all the majesty of a heathen temple,\\r\\nand loaded with strange idols: swans, dolphins, lions, and ostriches,\\r\\nturned slowly round like a monstrous humming-top, and near by was the\\r\\nvast curving canvas wall of the circus.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was surrounded by a happy crowd, but she could not mingle with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready her pink cheeks had drawn upon her the notice of a group of\\r\\nyoung farmers; it was clear to her that she could not visit the circus\\r\\nunless she went with a companion. At that moment she envied Maggie\\r\\nher freedom as she had never done before; Maggie, who might laugh or\\r\\nscream until her voice drowned the hurdy-gurdy, and who could answer\\r\\nback when a man spoke to her without anyone thinking the worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would be said if she, Miss Dunnock, the daughter of the vicar\\r\\nof Dry Coulter, were to try to win a coco-nut? Many of her father’s\\r\\nparishioners must be in town, and, with flagging footsteps, Anne passed\\r\\nby the entrance to the field full of merry-go-rounds, and walked slowly\\r\\non towards the railway station.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the great tent of the circus she could hear the thumping of the\\r\\nponies’ hoofs, the crack of the circus-master’s whip, and the falsetto\\r\\nnote of a clown’s voice, followed by a roar of rustic laughter and\\r\\nclapping hands; then, passing on, she came in view of the showmen’s\\r\\nencampment: a score of caravans with smoking chimneys, groups of\\r\\nhobbled ponies, and women carrying pails of water, hanging out washing,\\r\\nand preparing the evening meal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A curious life,” the girl said to herself. “Wandering from town to\\r\\ntown, roaming from one country to another, for the circus I see here\\r\\nmay be at Nizhninovgorod next summer and in Italy or Spain six months\\r\\nafter that. The women must have a hard life, but I would rather be one\\r\\nof them than the wife or daughter of a clergyman. If I were to join\\r\\nthem; but that cannot be--some dark woman would stab me rather than\\r\\nhave me for her daughter-in-law, yet if one of these handsome gipsies\\r\\nasked me, I would not hesitate to go with him. I would rather that my\\r\\nson were a clown or a lion-tamer than an archdeacon or a bishop.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne roused herself after a few minutes; the sun was setting, she felt\\r\\nchilly, and her thoughts had depressed her. “My mind runs in a circle,”\\r\\nshe said. “Whatever I see, whatever I do, I come back to the thought\\r\\nthat I am an outcast unable to share in the life around me, or to enjoy\\r\\nit, and that somehow I must escape from my surroundings, for I cannot\\r\\nlive any longer without friends.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned back towards the market place, for there is nothing more\\r\\ngloomy than an empty railway station, resolving to buy what she needed\\r\\nand then go home without delay.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Loneliness is terrible, and I have not got a friend in the world.\\r\\nThe worst fate which can befall a human being is to be born a young\\r\\nlady,” and meeting the gaze of a handsome gipsy with gold earrings, she\\r\\nadded: “I can see that I do not attract him; he does not care for young\\r\\nladies, and he is wise. We are an unhealthy, artificial breed; his\\r\\nwomen are better; they smell of tallow and wood ashes, and have the\\r\\nspirit and the health of mares.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne bought her drawing-pins and decided to go home, but first she\\r\\nwould have a cup of tea, and threading her way past a steam plough with\\r\\nseven shares, and through a series of galvanized iron cisterns, at\\r\\nwhich a group of farmers were gazing with intellectual doubt written on\\r\\ntheir faces, she crossed the market place and went into White’s. The\\r\\nturmoil of the fair had not penetrated inside the confectioner’s shop,\\r\\nand she would have thought that they had no knowledge of it there if it\\r\\nwere not that a greater primness reigned, and that the very gingerbread\\r\\nseemed weary of the flesh. Anne sipped her cup of tea with distaste,\\r\\nasking herself what the young ladies behind the counter would have said\\r\\nif she had given way to her desires, and they had seen her mounted on\\r\\nan ostrich.... Did they suffer from such temptations themselves?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had almost finished her cup of tea when the door opened and a\\r\\nlittle girl came in, followed by a short, thick-set, white-bearded man\\r\\nof sixty. It was Rachel, her favourite, and her father, Mr. Sotheby.\\r\\nRachel smiled, and all Anne’s depression was laid aside; even the tea,\\r\\ntasting of wet boots, seemed changed by the pleasure of their meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Rachel, have you been enjoying yourself at the fair?” she asked,\\r\\nlooking into the pale little face, framed in short dark curls. The\\r\\nchild nodded her head quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Miss Dunnock, thank you very much. I have been on the switchback,\\r\\nand enjoyed seeing the fair very much.” Rachel’s voice was always a\\r\\ntrifle stilted, her words always polite, and her sentiments always\\r\\nperfectly correct, but Anne noticed that on this occasion the child’s\\r\\nusual gaiety was lacking. A few words with the grocer were sufficient\\r\\nto explain the cause: Mr. Sotheby had brought Rachel into Linton to see\\r\\nthe fair, he had taken her twice on the roundabout, but his business\\r\\nwas waiting for him and must be done, and since he did not think it\\r\\nsuitable to let the child go to the circus alone, he was leaving her at\\r\\nWhite’s, where she would keep warm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come and choose yourself a cake, Rachel,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“May I take her to the circus, Mr. Sotheby?” asked Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere could be no refusal, and the two friends set off at once, Rachel\\r\\ncarrying the cheese-cake she had chosen, in her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came to meet Mr. Sotheby in the market place the two\\r\\ngirls left the circus, and still under the spell of the wonders they\\r\\nhad seen, it seemed as if they could never express sufficiently their\\r\\nadmiration and their astonishment. The pink horse and the fair rider of\\r\\nwhich Maggie had spoken that morning, and the clowns, who had appeared\\r\\nso suddenly that one might have thought a shower of frogs had fallen\\r\\ninto the ring after a thunderstorm, were discussed in detail, but best\\r\\nof all they had liked the handsome young man who had stood on his head\\r\\non a trapeze, and who, without holding on with his hands, had swung\\r\\nrapidly from one side of the great roof of the circus to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Sotheby was driving out of the inn-yard as they reached the market\\r\\nplace, and Anne was about to say good-bye, when the grocer offered her\\r\\na seat in his dog-cart, saying that he would not hear of her walking\\r\\nback alone. She was grateful for his offer, for she had no great fancy\\r\\nfor the six-mile walk herself, and soon they were all ready, tucked up\\r\\nin a large rug, with nothing to be seen of Rachel, crouching against\\r\\ntheir legs, but the tassel of her woollen cap. Mr. Sotheby flicked\\r\\nthe pony with his whip, and in a few moments they had crossed the old\\r\\nbridge over the river, and had left Linton behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the drive home, Anne’s thoughts ran on the young man, dressed\\r\\nin scarlet tights like Mephistopheles; she could not forget his proud\\r\\nand serious face, intent only on his trapeze and indifferent to the\\r\\naudience; she would never forget that unsmiling face, looking up at the\\r\\ntrapeze above him, as he deliberately rubbed first the soles of his\\r\\nshoes, and then his hands, in a box of sand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she could not speak of the young man, or of the circus, to Mr.\\r\\nSotheby, whom she disliked; she could not continue her happy talk with\\r\\nRachel in front of him, and they drove in silence--a silence broken at\\r\\nlast by the grocer remarking on the number of foreigners that there\\r\\nwere at the fair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing interests us country folk more than to see a foreigner,” said\\r\\nhe. “A black man will draw a crowd anywhere, and no wonder either, for\\r\\nhowever contented we may be with our own lives, we always wish to learn\\r\\nabout those of other people.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is a foreigner, of course,” Anne was saying to herself. “Perhaps\\r\\nif I went to the circus again to-morrow I might learn his name, and\\r\\nwhether he is an Italian or a Spaniard,” but she roused herself, for\\r\\nMr. Sotheby was still speaking, and then, wondering whether his words\\r\\nrequired an answer, she looked about her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risen moon was nearly full: there were no stars, and the road\\r\\nbefore them sparkled with frost. “How fast we are driving,” she\\r\\nreflected. “There is nothing like a frost to make a pony go, and no\\r\\ndoubt he is thinking of his stable.” The sound of the hoofs rang out;\\r\\nthe air was much colder than in the morning, so cold that it hurt her\\r\\nto breathe.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My son Richard is abroad, living in Paris,” said the grocer, and\\r\\nhearing his voice, Anne told herself that politeness required her to\\r\\nlisten. If she married the trapezist she might live in Paris, too--or\\r\\nelse they would travel from town to town wherever there were circuses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Before that boy was eight years old,” Mr. Sotheby went on, “I knew\\r\\nthat he would have to be a gentleman, and I am proud to say that I\\r\\nalways encouraged him to do what he wanted with his life.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would call him Lorenzo. What did it matter whether Lorenzo was\\r\\na gentleman or not? And Anne said this to herself, certain that the\\r\\nboy who had swung so gracefully on the trapeze was a gentleman. “For\\r\\nwhat is gentility but pride and perfect dignity? And he is as proud as\\r\\nLucifer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everyone says that I spoil Richard,” and the old man beside her\\r\\ncracked his whip gaily. “But as long as I can make money I shall send\\r\\nit to him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sure you are quite right,” said Anne. Money! If only she had a\\r\\nlittle money! How that would simplify things!\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Sotheby had needed no encouragement, and went on speaking: “All\\r\\nthese farmers hoard their money, and laugh at me for spending mine,\\r\\nbut I always say that we are both in the right, for they haven’t sons\\r\\nlike my Richard. What good is money to my wife and me?” he asked,\\r\\nbut, without waiting for a reply, continued: “To him it means books,\\r\\neducation, painting in the best studios, and the company of his equals,\\r\\nfor he would not find his equals about here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, money means all that and more,” thought Anne, but aloud she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is Lorenzo a painter, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My son Richard? No, he is an artist. I am fond of pictures myself, so\\r\\nI can understand him. I have seen some by the great men: Rembrandt,\\r\\nTurner, and Wouverman. There is a fine gallery at Norwich.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am very fond of pictures, too,” said Anne. “I have always wanted to\\r\\ntry oils; perhaps I shall one day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought at first of sending Richard to Cambridge,” said the grocer,\\r\\nfor he was not interested in Anne’s chances of painting. “But he said\\r\\nno to it. ‘There’s only one place where I can learn to be an artist,’\\r\\nhe said. ‘Paris is the only place for that.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Sotheby shook the reins, and murmured to his pony as they crossed\\r\\na little bridge, then he continued: “One hears a great deal about the\\r\\nwickedness of Paris; several of our ministers have spoken to me about\\r\\nit, but I console myself with thinking that none of those men would\\r\\nmind letting their boys go to sea, and there is as much wickedness in\\r\\nHull or Swansea as anywhere on earth.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel shifted her position under the rug, and suddenly thrusting her\\r\\nhead out, looked about her with curiosity, like a little monkey.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do the sailors believe in the Pope of Rome, father?” she asked in her\\r\\nprecise voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne did not listen to the reply. Of course Lorenzo was a Roman\\r\\nCatholic. Her father would be heartbroken, but she would give up\\r\\neverything for Lorenzo. Together they would voyage over the roads of\\r\\nEurope, their horses trotting on through the night, while the van they\\r\\nwere sleeping in rocked gently on its springs. In the early morning\\r\\nshe would wake to find that they were encamped by the side of a\\r\\nstream; the curling smoke of the wood fire would be rising beneath an\\r\\nash tree; and near at hand the piebald horses would be hobbled, and\\r\\nhappily grazing on the dew-soaked grass. She would wander along the\\r\\nhedge-row, startling a wood pigeon which would rise from the cornfield,\\r\\nand catching sight of the black and white of a magpie stealing along\\r\\nthe edge of the wood. Soon she would return with her arms full of\\r\\ndog-roses, and would give one to Lorenzo to wear in his buttonhole; and\\r\\nin the evening she would see the fragile flower pinned to his breast as\\r\\nhe swung on the trapeze.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Scripture tells us,” said Mr. Sotheby, “that children should honour\\r\\ntheir parents, but I feel a respect for my son which I never felt for\\r\\nmy father, and which I don’t expect Richard to feel for me. I know\\r\\nthat he works as hard at his painting as I should expect him to work\\r\\nif he had stayed in the shop, though of course he earns no money by\\r\\nit. Perhaps he never will, for the qualities necessary are not the\\r\\nsame, and Richard has spoken of men as great as Wouverman, living and\\r\\npainting in Paris to-day, who cannot sell their pictures. I would\\r\\nrather that Richard were to become a great master than that he were to\\r\\nsell a picture for hundreds of guineas, and incur the contempt of such\\r\\nmen. Money is not everything: one need only read one’s Bible to see\\r\\nthat.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pony slackened its speed, and turned a corner; they were back at\\r\\nDry Coulter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Steady, boy,” said the grocer, pulling up at the vicarage gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you very much, Mr. Sotheby,” said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A pleasure, Miss Dunnock; thank you for taking Rachel to the circus.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-night, Mr. Sotheby. Good-night Rachel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-night, Miss Dunnock, thank you for your kindness,” came the\\r\\nchild’s voice as the pony darted off impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a glorious moon,” Anne said to herself. “And what a hard frost!\\r\\nThere will be skating without a doubt.” She would have liked to go\\r\\nfor a long walk to straighten out her tangled feelings, but it was\\r\\nhalf-past seven: it was time to lay the table for dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps Lorenzo is married,” she said to herself suddenly. “Then we\\r\\ncan only be friends,” she added as she opened the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFIVE: THE FROST HELD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frost held. On Sunday morning the little boys lingered round the\\r\\nedges of the Broad Ditch on their way to chapel, and Mr. Dunnock,\\r\\nhurrying to the vestry, noticed Mr. Lambert’s foxhound puppy running\\r\\nacross the ice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There will be skating,” he said to himself, “and I have not lived\\r\\nall my life in the fens for nothing. I can still show the younger men\\r\\nsomething,” and he decided to ask Anne to cut sandwiches. They would\\r\\nspend the morrow at Bluntisham:--a long walk, but one which would\\r\\nrepay them with the finest stretch of ice in Huntingdonshire, and at\\r\\nBluntisham Mr. Dunnock would see the best figure skaters and be seen by\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter evening service he tapped the barometer, asking himself if it\\r\\nwould be tempting Providence if he were to look at the skates that\\r\\nevening. There might be a screw missing, a strap needed, or a broken\\r\\nbootlace, and such little things were best attended to overnight, he\\r\\nreflected, trying to conceal his eagerness, for he would not be happy\\r\\nuntil he had handled his skates.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They will be in the box-room,” he said, taking a candle with him from\\r\\nthe hall, but in the box-room many things met his eye which reminded\\r\\nhim of his life at Ely. It had been a wretched subordinate existence,\\r\\nsupporting his wife and daughter on a hundred and twenty pounds a year,\\r\\nbut as he looked back on it such things were forgotten, and it seemed\\r\\nto him that his life there had been a happy one, for it had been shared\\r\\nwith the woman he loved. Setting down his candle, he turned over the\\r\\nJapanese screen, which he had always liked for the storks flying across\\r\\nit, embroidered in silver thread. His wife had intended to re-cover\\r\\nthe screen, for the storks were tarnished, and the silver threads\\r\\nunravelling, but she had died before she had found a suitable piece of\\r\\nstuff. “She is in Heaven,” he said mechanically, and was surprised once\\r\\nagain that the words with which he comforted others held no consolation\\r\\nfor him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“An old age passed together would have brought a closer understanding\\r\\nbetween us,” he said, suddenly speaking his innermost thought, which\\r\\nhe had not admitted to himself before, for the clergyman’s tragedy was\\r\\nnever to have had the conviction of perfect understanding or intimacy,\\r\\neven with his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the middle years of life we live too much in the affairs of the\\r\\nday, and a child troubles the mind of its mother. So many burdens to\\r\\nbe borne, so many duties to be fulfilled.... We were too occupied to\\r\\nlook into each other’s hearts, and old age, the sweetest portion of\\r\\nlife if it be filled with harmony, and the happiness of memories shared\\r\\nin common, old age is reserved for me only; a lonely and miserable old\\r\\nage. Now that I have lost Mavis, intimacy is impossible with anyone\\r\\nelse, and I feel myself growing far away from everyone, and farthest\\r\\nof all from Anne. She reminds me too closely of her mother; I find it\\r\\npainful to be with her and I find her youth as tiresome as she finds my\\r\\nhasty temper.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dunnock told himself that such feelings must be controlled, but\\r\\nhe had said that before, and had no faith that the strangeness which\\r\\nseemed to be growing upon him could be overcome. “Death will release\\r\\nme, and I must console myself with the hope that Mavis is waiting\\r\\nfor me in Heaven, that she will fold me in her wings, and take me to\\r\\nherself without a word of reproach. When I hear the birds singing in\\r\\nthe mornings they repeat that promise, and once or twice I have had the\\r\\nconviction that when I looked out of our bedroom window I should see\\r\\nangels perched in the branches of the trees.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three pairs of skates lay on a shelf, the blades had been smeared\\r\\nwith vaseline and wrapped in greaseproof paper, but the boots were\\r\\ndusty, and stretched stiffly over the boxwood trees.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, the skates will be all right: there will be nothing amiss\\r\\nwith them,” for they had been greased by _her_ hands; it was _she_ who\\r\\nhad laid them aside after the frost last winter a few weeks before her\\r\\ndeath.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road to Bluntisham was long, and, as she walked with her father,\\r\\nAnne thought about bicycles. Her father had once had a bicycle, but\\r\\nthat was many years ago; he appeared to have no wish to possess\\r\\nanother, and Anne had never summoned up sufficient courage to buy\\r\\none for herself, though the price of a bicycle was lying idly in the\\r\\nsavings bank at the Post Office.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall certainly buy a bicycle,” she thought. “It is madness not to\\r\\nhave got one before; a bicycle would give me the freedom for which I\\r\\npine; what the horse is to the Arab of the desert, a bicycle is to a\\r\\ngirl in my position. I could ride to Cambridge; in Cambridge I could go\\r\\nto concerts, and even plays; I could ride to Peterborough.” But she\\r\\ndid not finish her thought, for she was uncertain what Peterborough\\r\\nwould give her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I had a bicycle I should make friends and instead of wasting my\\r\\nlife like a fool, dreaming about acrobats at a travelling circus, I\\r\\nshould meet Cambridge undergraduates, and receive invitations to play\\r\\ntennis, or to join in a picnic party on the river.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Anne was thinking of all the changes which would come into her\\r\\nlife when she bought herself a bicycle, her father was enjoying the\\r\\nexercise of walking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am a great pedestrian,” he had said to the Bishop, and although he\\r\\nscarcely ever went outside his house if he could avoid it, the saying\\r\\nwas true, and it was all his daughter could do to keep up with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBluntisham Church stands as the last outpost over the flooded fen\\r\\ncountry; a little beyond, at Earith, is the starting point of the\\r\\nBedford Level, which runs for thirty miles to King’s Lynn without a\\r\\nhedge, or a tree, or even as much as a mole-hill to break the flat\\r\\nexpanse--green all the summer, but under water, or rather under ice\\r\\nwhen the Dunnocks approached it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father and daughter had in common a great liking for the fens; they\\r\\nloved the black peaty earth, the vast level expanse of sodden land,\\r\\nwhich looked flatter than the sea, when viewed from the high banks\\r\\nof a causeway running through it, or the embankments of the Bedford\\r\\nRiver raised up above the fields which it drained; they liked even the\\r\\nsqualid villages on each side of the level, the low houses clustering\\r\\nwherever a hillock projecting into the fenland made it possible for man\\r\\nto build. But better than the Bedford Level of the present day, they\\r\\nloved to think of the fens of the past, and of the struggle to reclaim\\r\\nthem which had begun with the war between the Romans and the Iceni,\\r\\nflitting from islet to islet in their osier coracles, sheltering behind\\r\\nthe willows, and making a night attack on the legionaries posted to\\r\\ndefend the bridge at Huntingdon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they drew near Bluntisham they began to speak of these things,\\r\\nand Mr. Dunnock soon passed from the invasions of the Danes to the\\r\\nprosperous farmers who tilled the lands reclaimed by the Romans until\\r\\nthe twelfth or fourteenth century, when the fields relapsed into\\r\\nfenland, and soon they reached the great days of the seventeenth\\r\\ncentury, for, as Mr. Dunnock said, the history of the Commonwealth\\r\\nis to be found in the Fens of Huntingdonshire, and the Commonwealth\\r\\nitself may be regarded as a mere episode in the struggle between the\\r\\nUplanders and the Lowlanders.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Mr. Dunnock was an Uplander by birth, and a High Churchman, he\\r\\nwas proud of the part that the inhabitants of the swamps had played in\\r\\nEnglish history.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Without the three men of Godmanchester there would have been no Magna\\r\\nCharta, and if Charles had not tried to drain the Fens, there is little\\r\\ndoubt he would have won the Civil War,” he said, and went on telling\\r\\nAnne how as a young man Oliver must have made the reflection that his\\r\\nfamily had been ruined by the Stuarts, who had encouraged their hopes\\r\\nand given them nothing. It was a good reason for him to repent of his\\r\\nloose life, and become more determined a Puritan. Soon he was stirring\\r\\nup trouble against the church in St. Ives; then his uncle, Sir Thomas\\r\\nSteward, died, leaving him his heir, and Oliver removed to Ely, but the\\r\\ntemptation to make trouble still persisted, and when one next hears of\\r\\nhim he was giving money to the Fen Dwellers and helping them to resist\\r\\nthe drainage schemes of the King’s Adventurers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Adventurers’ Fen is called after them,” said Anne, and her father\\r\\nanswered that it might well be so, and they stopped for a moment to\\r\\nlook out towards the fen in question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At that time the people in the fens lived by fishing and wild\\r\\nfowling,” said Mr. Dunnock. “Every week during the winter a train of\\r\\nwaggons left Linton for London loaded with wild duck,” and he continued\\r\\nhis story of how when the King was engaged in reclaiming the fen, the\\r\\nbirds were driven from their nesting grounds, and the great decoys\\r\\nwoven of osiers were being left high and dry, so that the lowlanders\\r\\nforesaw that they would have to abandon a mode of livelihood which had\\r\\nendured since the Iceni. They had no desire to plough and reap, and the\\r\\ndrained lands did not prove fertile until a century afterwards, when\\r\\nthe farmers were shown how to dig through the peat and quarry clay to\\r\\nmix with it, after which it became the most fruitful soil in England.\\r\\nOliver Cromwell had taken up their cause, and later, when the Duke of\\r\\nManchester was letting victory slip out of the hands of the Parliament,\\r\\nit was Cromwell who impeached him, and then, seeking an army, turned\\r\\nfor his New Model to the Fens. It was Cromwell who equipped the\\r\\nLowlanders, and headed the Eastern Association, and it was the Eastern\\r\\nAssociation which had won the Civil War, and so the Cromwells had their\\r\\nrevenge on the Stuarts. But though the lowlanders had been made use of,\\r\\nthe work of drainage went on, and the Ironsides who had been enlisted\\r\\nto resist the draining of the fens were betrayed by old Ironsides\\r\\nhimself, the Lord Protector.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by the time Mr. Dunnock had reached this crowning example of the\\r\\nperfidy of the figure he so much hated, they had turned the corner\\r\\nbelow Bluntisham Church, and saw before them the great expanse of ice\\r\\ncovered with the descendants of Cromwell’s Ironsides.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe field beside the road was full of motorcars, of farmers’ gigs,\\r\\nwaggonettes, and grazing ponies, and at the entrance stood the farmer\\r\\nasking a penny from every person who went on the ice. No crop had\\r\\never yielded so handsome a profit as his flooded water-meadows, and\\r\\nno fenman in Cromwell’s day would have fought more bitterly against a\\r\\nscheme which would have kept it drained during the winter months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noise of hundreds of pairs of skates on the ice came to their ears\\r\\nas they entered the field,--a grumbling sound that had within it a note\\r\\nwhich rang as clear as a bell, and they sat down to unlace their boots,\\r\\nrefusing the offer of a chair which would mean spending another penny.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was the first on the ice, and as her father watched her hesitating\\r\\nstrokes the feeling of affection, which the conversation about\\r\\nCromwell had aroused, gave place to one of shame and irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Am I to be tied to such a limpet all day?” he asked himself as he\\r\\nhad so often asked himself before when skating with his wife; then,\\r\\nwithout giving his daughter another look, he hobbled rapidly to the\\r\\nedge of the ice and was off himself, slipping away as easily as a\\r\\nswallow that recovers the freedom of its element after beating against\\r\\nthe window-panes. His own strokes were as effortless as the flickering\\r\\nof a bird’s wing, and it was impossible for the onlookers watching him\\r\\nto say what kept him in motion. Mr. Dunnock never appeared to strike\\r\\noff, but leant gracefully forward, lifting a leg slightly to cross\\r\\nhis feet, and, changing his weight from one leg to the other, he flew\\r\\nlazily across the ice, picking his way without appearing to observe\\r\\nthe existence of the clumsy young farmers who doubled up, and, with\\r\\ntheir hands clasped behind their backs, dashed round and round at top\\r\\nspeed on their long fen skates. Soon everyone had noticed the tall\\r\\nclergyman with his beard tucked under a white woollen muffler, and many\\r\\npaused to watch as he began figure-skating in the real English style.\\r\\nEight after eight was drawn with the slow precision of a sleepy rook\\r\\nwheeling in the evening sky, before descending in a perfect spiral to\\r\\nroost on the topmost bough of the high elm, and indeed the black-coated\\r\\nfigure forgot for a few moments that he was an elderly vicar on a\\r\\npair of skates, and believed himself to be circling in space among a\\r\\nvast flock of waterfowl flying over the fens. It seemed to him as if\\r\\nat intervals a V-shaped band of wild duck flashed past him, each with\\r\\nits neck craned forward, and beating furiously with its short, clumsy\\r\\nwings; a flock of curlew was all about him, and would wheel suddenly in\\r\\nits tracks with a flash of white, then a stray snipe corkscrewed past,\\r\\na pair of greedy seagulls chased each other, and two roseate terns\\r\\nrevolved round each other on their nuptial flight....\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf an hour had gone by when his dream was interrupted by a young\\r\\nman with pink cheeks and rather protruding black eyes, who skated up\\r\\nto him and addressed him by name. It was Mr. Yockney, Dr. Boulder’s\\r\\nassistant, whose professional duties brought him to Dry Coulter when\\r\\nthere was a birth, or death, but rarely at other times:--the villagers\\r\\nwere uncommonly healthy, and on the rare occasions when they took cold,\\r\\nor developed inflammation of the lungs, they doctored each other with\\r\\ngaseous mixture, or turpentine and honey.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, so you are here,” said Mr. Dunnock, shaking hands warmly, for\\r\\nyoung Yockney had attended Mrs. Dunnock in her last illness, and his\\r\\nsympathy and tenderness to the dying woman would never be forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Doctor Boulder gave me the day off. This frost is so healthy we\\r\\nhave no patients left; but it’s an ill-wind that blows nobody any good,\\r\\nand I would not miss a day’s skating like this for the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dunnock said that Doctor Boulder must write to the Clerk of the\\r\\nWeather about the deplorably healthy winter. Mr. Yockney laughed, and\\r\\nthen both of them remembered that it must be lunch time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, Yockney, you must join us,” said Mr. Dunnock, and Anne, coming\\r\\nup at that moment, added her invitation, which the young man was glad\\r\\nenough to accept.\\r\\n\\r\\nA line of trestles had been put up on the ice, and crowds were waiting\\r\\nround the shoemaker’s, and the men who let out skates for hire,\\r\\nbut most popular of all were the sellers of hot potatoes and roast\\r\\nchestnuts with their buckets of glowing coals. Mr. Yockney purchased\\r\\nthree steaming cups of cocoa, while Anne went to fetch the satchel full\\r\\nof sandwiches, and in a little while they were sitting on the edge of a\\r\\ngrassy bank.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have been seeing a friend of yours, Miss Dunnock,” said the doctor\\r\\nafter the second sandwich. “Little Rachel Sotheby, and I fear that it\\r\\nmay have been your doing that I had to be called in, for I understand\\r\\nit was you who took her to the circus. She caught a chill on the way\\r\\nback. Oh, no, it is nothing in the least serious, though she is rather\\r\\ndelicate.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne expressed her concern, and hastened to explain to her father how\\r\\nshe had met the Sothebys in the tea-shop, and had taken the little girl\\r\\nto see the circus.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Extraordinary chap that old grocer is,” said Mr. Yockney. “He’d\\r\\nhave been a rich man by now, I fancy, if it had not been for that\\r\\ngood-for-nothing son of his. Just fancy, he told me that he was\\r\\nspending all his money on making his son a gentleman!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seemed to Mr. Dunnock an excellent joke, and he laughed heartily.\\r\\nHe disliked the grocer for his assurance, and his cheerfulness, and his\\r\\nnonconformity, and was ready to hear anything to his disadvantage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The great news,” continued Mr. Yockney, “only I expect you know it, is\\r\\nthat the prodigal is expected home next week. He’s been in Paris, and\\r\\nhas been going the pace a bit, I fancy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I am so glad,” said Anne with real interest showing in her\\r\\nvoice. “I have heard so much about him from Mr. Sotheby, and I quite\\r\\nlook forward to seeing what he’s like. He sounds quite an interesting\\r\\nperson.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA frown gathered on her father’s face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, we are all eager to see him,” said the doctor, and then the\\r\\ntone of his voice changed so completely that Anne could see that it\\r\\nwas another, and a serious Mr. Yockney who was speaking, although she\\r\\nobserved that his eyes bulged just as much when he was serious as when\\r\\nhe was only talking lightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you ask me, Miss Dunnock, I should say that young man is the very\\r\\nworst type of rotter. Look at the old grocer sweating away at sixty,\\r\\nlook at his mother still serving in the shop, look at his little\\r\\nsister with patches on the sides of her boots, while Master Richard\\r\\nis learning to be a _gentleman_ in Paris! There’s no word too bad for\\r\\nhim. I should like him to know what decent people think of that sort of\\r\\ngentility!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had better tell him, my dear fellow,” said Mr. Dunnock languidly.\\r\\n“It would do him a world of good, I’ve no doubt. But I must say it\\r\\nis probably not the fault of the son but because of the vanity of\\r\\nthe father. Over and over again I have seen a young oaf of that\\r\\ndescription produced by a couple of vain and silly parents who ruin\\r\\ntheir children’s lives by denying them nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But no decent chap, you must admit....” said Mr. Yockney.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You think the son is to blame because you are nearer his age and\\r\\nimagine yourself in his position,” said Mr. Dunnock with a smile. “But\\r\\nI, as a father, imagine myself in the position of our excellent grocer.\\r\\nIf I were to bring Anne up to expect luxuries, and to suppose that she\\r\\nwas born to lead an idle, useless existence, it would not be her fault\\r\\nif she grew up a silly and discontented woman.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEven without this argument Anne was feeling decidedly uncomfortable,\\r\\nand a clumsy piece of gallantry from Mr. Yockney added to her\\r\\nirritation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stupid, coarse, hidebound brute! Do your eyes bulge because of your\\r\\nmanly virtue?” she said under her breath, but she had to confess that\\r\\nthere was something in what the doctor had said. She had not noticed\\r\\nthe patches on Rachel’s boots herself, and she felt her respect for Mr.\\r\\nYockney as a doctor increasing with her dislike of him as a man. If it\\r\\nwere true, it was disgraceful that Rachel should not have a sound pair\\r\\nof boots, but it was absurd to object to Mrs. Sotheby serving in the\\r\\nshop; would she have been happier at a hydro in Harrogate?\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dunnock had continued a whimsical description of how he might have\\r\\nbrought up his daughter so that she would have been discontented with\\r\\nher life; the doctor replied, but finally they agreed that both of the\\r\\nSothebys, father and son, were very much to blame, when Anne remarked,\\r\\nin a voice which trembled, that she was fond of the Sothebys and that\\r\\nshe thought that it was very fine of them to sacrifice themselves in\\r\\norder to make their son a great artist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can trust you not to be taken in by the word _gentleman_, Anne,\\r\\nbut I am afraid you may be by the word _artist_. Art, you know, Mr.\\r\\nYockney, covers a multitude of sins.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The best definition of art I have ever heard,” said the doctor, “is\\r\\nthat it is the opposite of work.” Mr. Dunnock laughed approvingly,\\r\\nand Mr. Yockney went on, his eyes bulging more than ever with the\\r\\nseriousness of his appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Miss Dunnock, whatever you may say, I know that the kind of\\r\\ncaddish selfishness we have been talking about is absolutely abhorrent\\r\\nto you, as it is to all decent people. I quite agree with you that\\r\\nthere is something pathetic in the old Sothebys, but there is nothing\\r\\nto be said for the son.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, they seem to be an unusually happy family,” answered Anne,\\r\\nfeeling that she had lost her temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am too old to play at Happy Families any longer,” said her father\\r\\nwith a titter. “I shall go back to the ice and leave Mr. Yockney and\\r\\nyou to settle the momentous question of Master Grits the Grocer’s son.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSIX: WINGED SEEDS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why is it?” Anne Dunnock asked herself next day, “that my father can\\r\\nbe pleasant to other people but not to me? Though to be sure I fancied\\r\\nyesterday that his pleasantness to Mr. Yockney was a trifle vulgar,\\r\\nwhile his unpleasantness to me has at all events the merit of being\\r\\nsincere and well-bred.” And Anne told herself that the only explanation\\r\\nmust be that she was as much a burden to her father as he was to her.\\r\\n“But only I realize it,” she burst out. “For I am young enough to\\r\\nrecognize the truth, and to welcome it; he does not understand himself\\r\\nor other people; all his life he has hidden his head in the sand like\\r\\nan ostrich, and after all what else can one expect of a clergyman?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer anger had lasted since the conversation about the Sothebys, for her\\r\\nirritation during the lunch beside the ice had been quickly followed by\\r\\nfatigue, which had intensified her resentment. After the unaccustomed\\r\\nexercise her ankles seemed to have turned to jelly, and the eight-mile\\r\\nwalk from Bluntisham had been torture to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never again,” she said to herself; and when Mr. Lambert had stopped\\r\\nat the door next morning to offer her a place in his gig (he was going\\r\\nto Bluntisham for the skating), she had refused, and her father had\\r\\naccepted in her place.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I want any skating I shall go on the Broad Ditch,” she had said,\\r\\na remark which had estranged Mr. Dunnock more than her sullenness the\\r\\nprevious day had done, and he drove off with a hurt look which said:\\r\\n“You are no daughter of mine to speak of skating in such a way before a\\r\\nstranger!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gig was out of sight Anne went indoors to write a letter to\\r\\nCoventry for a catalogue of bicycles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe catalogue came, but though she selected a machine, she hesitated\\r\\nto post the letter ordering it, and after a week’s indecision she tore\\r\\nit up, since the thought had come to her that a bicycle would tie her\\r\\nmore firmly than ever to her life with her father, and this life seemed\\r\\nevery day to become less endurable.\\r\\n\\r\\nA thaw followed quickly on the second day of skating, and after that\\r\\nrain and sleet fell for several days. Mr. Dunnock appeared to be\\r\\nequally disgusted by the weather and by his daughter, and retired to\\r\\nhis study, scarcely a word being exchanged throughout the day except\\r\\nat breakfast, when Mr. Dunnock always reminded Anne of her duties in\\r\\nthe parish.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A bicycle would rivet me to my present life,” said Anne to herself.\\r\\n“What a chain is to a yard-dog, a bicycle is to the daughter of a\\r\\nclergyman! A bicycle would give me a certain radius of movement; it\\r\\nwould fill the emptiness of my life; but I want things that no bicycle\\r\\ncan give me. Yes, I want books, music, beautiful clothes, and more\\r\\nthan any of these I want what they stand for: that is, the society of\\r\\nintelligent men and cultivated women. Such hopes are vain, I know:\\r\\nI shall never succeed in ‘unwinding the accursed chain’--still I\\r\\nshall attempt it and the best way to set about it is certainly not by\\r\\nentangling myself with a bicycle. Even if I had to live in solitude I\\r\\nshould prefer independence, and that I can achieve, for the world is\\r\\nfull of women who earn their own living. Ten pounds is more valuable to\\r\\nme than a machine with plated rims or a little oil-bath; no one ever\\r\\nran away from home on a bicycle, and I shall want all my savings for a\\r\\nrailway ticket and lodgings in London while I look about me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the letter ordering the bicycle was torn up, and the catalogue\\r\\nitself cast into the fire, since it was a temptation to the flesh, one\\r\\nwhich assailed her particularly in the evenings; the ten pounds was\\r\\nreplaced to her credit in the Savings Bank, and several days were spent\\r\\nin turning over the best way of earning her living.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall go away from here, that is clear,” she said. “I have known\\r\\nthat ever since the ploughmen came that snowy morning. Here the\\r\\naccursed chain can never be unwound, but when I am living a free life,\\r\\namong new people, and my father is forgotten, I shall escape, and\\r\\nspeaking easily to everyone I shall be accepted by them; I shall love;\\r\\nI shall be beloved....” Anne shook her head and a shower of hairpins\\r\\nflew out on to the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Damn the elastic stuff!” she cried. “Why do I endure it a moment\\r\\nlonger?” and, tears coming into her eyes, she started up and seized a\\r\\npair of scissors out of her workbasket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There will be time enough for that later on,” and the scissors were\\r\\ndropped as she told herself that she must plan for the future, and not\\r\\ndissipate her emotions in the present.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet another week was spent in considering how she could earn her\\r\\nliving, and March came in like a lamb before she had arrived at any\\r\\npractical decision.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The birds sing and build their nests, soon they will be laying their\\r\\neggs, and then father will be in agonies whenever a young thrush\\r\\nhops across the lawn, lest it should fall between Pussy’s paws. The\\r\\nsnowdrops are over long ago, the hyacinths have broken through the\\r\\nground, their fat buds look like pine-cones. First came the daffodils,\\r\\nthe double ones, and then the single. The peaches are showing their\\r\\npink petals on the walls of the dove house, but I remain where I am, I\\r\\ncannot flower, unfold my petals or spread my wings....”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen her father spoke to her of the migrant birds flitting northwards\\r\\nthrough Africa and Spain and Italy and France, from bush to bush,\\r\\ntwenty yards by twenty yards, to find their way to England’s shores\\r\\n“where alone they find the happiness of love,” said Mr. Dunnock, “and\\r\\nwhere alone they sing,” Anne vowed fiercely that before the last of the\\r\\nmigrants arrived she would be gone herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The cuckoo will be here in six weeks,” said she to herself. “The\\r\\nnightingale will be here a week after; I shall stay to hear one but\\r\\nnot the other. Which it will be I cannot tell, for sometimes the\\r\\nnightingale comes before the cuckoo, and that they say is the luckier.\\r\\nI hope I shall hear the nightingale before I go and not the cuckoo; it\\r\\nwould be an omen that I should find a true lover waiting for me, and\\r\\nnot a deceiver.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spring pleased her and excited her, and an hour or two was spent\\r\\nhappily searching for the first wild flowers, and gathering the\\r\\nsweet-scented white violets which grew under the old apple trees, but\\r\\nmeeting her father at lunch and hearing him speak to her of the Sunday\\r\\nschool reminded her of her resolution to leave him, and at that moment\\r\\nthe beauty of the springtime seemed nothing but a reflection of the\\r\\nweakness of her character.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can I leave him? He is helpless, and I am useful to him. Who will\\r\\nteach in the Sunday school? Who will keep up the thin pretence that\\r\\nhe cares what happens to his parishioners when I am gone? Without me\\r\\nwho will order his meals, and who will keep a watch on the bacon? The\\r\\nPattles will rob him; they will eat him out of house and home.” But\\r\\nthough it seemed that it was impossible for her to leave her father\\r\\nhelpless, and though Anne knew that she loved him, she was soon going\\r\\nover her old arguments about how a girl can earn her living.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll her experiences had been no more than to pour out tea, and to\\r\\nteach in the Sunday school. Other women of her age she knew were able\\r\\nto be bank clerks, or the secretaries of business men, they worked in\\r\\nGovernment offices, they did typewriting, indeed there seemed nothing\\r\\nthat women did not do, but Anne doubted very much whether she could\\r\\nbecome a useful person of that kind. She had received what Mr. Dunnock\\r\\nhad called “the education of a lady” (that was no education at all),\\r\\nshe could not add up columns of figures, or use a typewriter, or write\\r\\nin shorthand. All she could do was to keep the children quiet, to tell\\r\\nthem Bible stories about Balaam’s ass, and Daniel in the den of lions;\\r\\nshe could order the groceries, check the washing, arrange a bowl of\\r\\nflowers, speak boarding-school French and struggle somehow through a\\r\\npiece of Schumann--letting the hammer notes sound rather weak as her\\r\\nfingers tired.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo earn her living seemed impossible unless she were to succeed with\\r\\nher fashion plates, or were to exchange one Sunday school for another.\\r\\nThat was always possible, and in another parish she would meet with a\\r\\ncurate who would ask her to marry him, for nowhere could a curate find\\r\\na better wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Better a bicycle than a curate!” she exclaimed. “I would rather cut my\\r\\nthroat than be the wife of a clergyman. Other duties perhaps I might\\r\\nface, but I have not the courage to work all my life for parishioners\\r\\nwho prefer to go to their own chapels, or to the public-house. It is\\r\\nthe fashion plates or suicide.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then Anne remembered that there were many elderly ladies in the\\r\\nworld whose incomes permitted the keeping of a donkey-carriage, with a\\r\\ncompanion to walk beside it. “Why should I not be such a companion?”\\r\\nshe asked. “In the winter her sciatica will require a change of\\r\\nclimate, and we shall go away together to the Riviera, or to Egypt.”\\r\\nAnd the rest of the afternoon was spent dreaming of the music she would\\r\\nbe hearing at Rome, of seeing the Sphinx by moonlight and visiting\\r\\nTutankhamen’s grave.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the evening she had decided to put an advertisement in _The Church\\r\\nTimes_, and at night lay awake repeating to herself the magic words\\r\\nwhich would bring her freedom: “A well-educated girl, daughter of a\\r\\nclergyman, requires situation as companion to a lady of means.” No,\\r\\nthat did not sound well: should she call herself “a respectable girl”?\\r\\nNo, not a respectable girl--that smacked of the kitchen. “A quiet girl,\\r\\nwith an old-fashioned education, desires to become the paid companion\\r\\nof a lady.” Nothing would do, but nevertheless the advertisement would\\r\\nhave to be sent, and finding sleep impossible, Anne took pen and paper\\r\\nand wrote first one sentence and then another until she had covered\\r\\nseveral sheets.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning all her efforts seemed vain, but at last she decided on\\r\\nsending the sentence which seemed to her to be the clearest. “Young\\r\\nlady, who has enjoyed a religious upbringing, wishes to see the world\\r\\nas the paid companion of a lady.” There was nothing more required but a\\r\\ncovering letter to the newspaper, and a postal order.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne put on her boots and hurried out into the blustering March wind.\\r\\nIt had broken the first hyacinth, and the daffodils were lying flat on\\r\\nthe earth. How the wind roared! It was pleasant to be out of the house,\\r\\nfor the chimneys had been smoking. The grass on the lawn was lashed\\r\\ninto white streaks by the wind before which the hens ran sideways, like\\r\\nold ladies crossing the road. There was a thick scum at one side of the\\r\\nbroad ditch, a scum of withered catkins fallen from the black poplars.\\r\\nCatkins hung like funereal trappings or like black caterpillars on\\r\\nevery twig of the apple trees; on the ditch, the ducks were dancing on\\r\\nthe waves.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Such a wind as this scatters the seeds,” said Anne. “The winged fruits\\r\\nof the elms and the maples are whirled up from the ditches where they\\r\\nhave been lying all the winter, and are carried over the tops of the\\r\\ntallest trees, and this wind will gather me up like a seed that has\\r\\nlain too long under the tree from which it fell. Heaven knows where it\\r\\nwill carry me! To Egypt or Greece, maybe, or perhaps only to pull the\\r\\nrug over the knees of an old lady driving her donkey-cart along the\\r\\nlanes of an adjoining parish.”\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the avenue of elms the wind roared so loud that Anne feared for\\r\\nthe safety of the trees, and stepped cautiously, looking up among the\\r\\nswaying branches. In her hand she held the precious letter that was to\\r\\nset her free, the letter which was to her as the wing is to the seed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Once this is posted, there is no turning back,” she thought. “There\\r\\nwill be difficulties, but they will be overcome, and when I look back\\r\\non my life I shall say it began on the day when I posted this letter,\\r\\nand I shall remember the March gale roaring like a lion among the elms.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA vision of an elderly lady with soft brown eyes like bees, and short\\r\\ngrey hair, haunted her: a precise lady she would be, perhaps one who\\r\\nhad been an actress or an opera singer in her day, and kept a casket\\r\\nof love-letters from all the poets of the ’eighties standing on the\\r\\ntable beside her. Her employer would laugh gently at her enthusiasm,\\r\\nand would tell her wonderful anecdotes. Her name would be beautiful,\\r\\nand familiar: a name that is to be found in every catalogue of roses,\\r\\nfor she was the kind of lady after whom roses are named. Anne would\\r\\ntake the place of a daughter, and would soon inherit all her passionate\\r\\nfire tempered by her knowledge of the world, all her deep wisdom born\\r\\nof experience and of renunciation; all her cynical clear-sighted witty\\r\\ntenderness....\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good morning, Miss Dunnock.” Anne’s day-dream was interrupted, and\\r\\nshe looked down to find Rachel Sotheby standing before her, her bright\\r\\neyes shining, and her cheeks flushed by the wind. Anne was pleased to\\r\\nsee the little girl, and thinking that they must part soon, she bent\\r\\ndown to kiss her, a thing she had not done before. As she did so, she\\r\\nremembered Mr. Yockney’s remark about Rachel’s boots and glanced at\\r\\nthem. Yes, they were stiff little boots, cracked behind the toe-caps,\\r\\nworn out, they would let in the water.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Yockney was quite right,” she said to herself, and entering the\\r\\nPost Office, was embarrassed to find a stranger standing at the counter\\r\\nwriting a telegram.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This must be Rachel’s brother,” she thought as she recognized the\\r\\nfoxey nose, and the slit eyes of the photograph she had seen in the\\r\\ngrocer’s parlour. “This must be Richard Sotheby, who has been turned\\r\\ninto a gentleman while his sister has holes in her boots.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Anne asked for her postal order she avoided looking at the young\\r\\nman of whom she had heard so much, but while she was waiting for\\r\\nthe pen (there was only one in the Post Office with which it was\\r\\npossible to write) she could not keep her eyes turned away, and when\\r\\nhe had finished his telegram, she had to meet his eye as he handed\\r\\nher the pen. The action was polite, but though their eyes met for an\\r\\ninstant, she could see that it was mechanical, she had not engaged his\\r\\nattention, he was thinking of his telegram, and next moment she heard\\r\\nhim spelling it over to Mrs. Day, the post-mistress, and explaining\\r\\nthat it was in French.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_The Church Times_....” wrote Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“G...R...A...N...D...I...S...O...N,” spelt the young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Barclays Bank and Co.,” wrote Anne, keeping her ears open but failing\\r\\nto follow the address.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had filled in her postal order and had sealed up her letter; there\\r\\nwas no reason to stay longer listening while Mrs. Day repeated the\\r\\nletters after him, and she went out, posted her letter, and turned\\r\\nhomewards. Already her emotions about her advertisement had subsided,\\r\\nand as she hurried under the storm-tossed elms her thoughts were\\r\\noccupied with the grocer’s son and his strange telegram.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Je suis las de tes amourettes et de mon amour. Je consens. Ecris.”\\r\\nWhat did that mean? And who was the Grandison to whom it was addressed?\\r\\n\\r\\nHer meditations were interrupted by Richard Sotheby himself, who passed\\r\\nher, walking rapidly down the avenue. His hat was jammed hard on his\\r\\nhead: he did not lift it, and directly he had passed she noticed that\\r\\nhe was wearing button boots made of patent leather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSEVEN: THE BURNT FARM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe March gale continued for several days; the daffodils were broken,\\r\\nthe hyacinths in the border laid low, but one morning Anne awoke to\\r\\nfind that not a breath of wind was stirring in the elms, and after an\\r\\nhour or so the sun was blazing with the heat of June. On the breakfast\\r\\ntable lay _The Church Times_, and she trembled with emotion when she\\r\\nsaw it in her father’s hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must speak to him,” she said to herself, “I must speak to him now,”\\r\\nbut she did not speak, consoling herself for her lack of resolution\\r\\nwith the thought that the earliest answers to her advertisement could\\r\\nnot arrive for two days, since they were to be forwarded from the\\r\\noffice in Fleet Street; she had not given her name and address, but had\\r\\nused a box number.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will speak to him to-morrow,” she said to herself. “For I would like\\r\\nto enjoy one day of perfect spring weather before I leave Dry Coulter,\\r\\nand our conversation is certain to upset us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe waited eagerly until the birds’ breakfast left her free to take\\r\\nthe newspaper into her hands. Her advertisement was in, and reading\\r\\nthe modest three lines Anne felt her heart swell with the triumph of\\r\\nauthorship, and she ran upstairs with _The Church Times_ in her hand to\\r\\nread the announcement over and over to herself in private.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is no turning back now!” she exclaimed. “I have shown my\\r\\nindependence; I have taken the first step, and nothing now can keep me\\r\\nfrom achieving my purpose.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s eyes flashed as she turned to the looking-glass; and the\\r\\neager look she met there intoxicated her: at that moment she almost\\r\\nsuffocated with the sense of her own power. The blood rushed to her\\r\\nhead, and she clenched her fists, and ground her teeth in the effort to\\r\\nremain calm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you seen _The Church Times_?” called Mr. Dunnock, coming back\\r\\nfrom watching the birds.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here it is, father,” she answered, and running downstairs surrendered\\r\\nit to him without a tremor. Her father took it absentmindedly, saying\\r\\nas he did so:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think there is some straw somewhere, my dear. Would you ask Noah to\\r\\nscatter it about the lawn? It will be useful for the sparrows; the\\r\\nnearest rick is several hundred yards away, a long journey for them,\\r\\nalmost an impossible one if the wind should veer to the east. On a calm\\r\\nday like this, it is not so important, but there are not many calm days\\r\\nin March, and in any case it will save a great deal of trouble.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt another moment Anne might have been vexed at her father’s solicitude\\r\\nfor the hated sparrows, but she was in a mood to forgive his follies,\\r\\nand she ran off at once to the potting-shed to find the straw, and\\r\\nscattered it on the lawn herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the morning she was beside herself with excitement; and she found\\r\\nit hard to answer Maggie sensibly when she spoke of their plan of\\r\\nwhitewashing the scullery. When the proposal had been put forward a\\r\\nfortnight before by Anne, it had seemed to mark an epoch, but Maggie\\r\\nfound that it was suddenly brushed on one side, her feelings were hurt,\\r\\nthe date was left uncertain, and Anne had fled out into the garden\\r\\nbefore she had time to question her again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first tulips were standing stiffly to attention in their field-grey\\r\\nuniforms, their buds unopened, but the girl could not think of tulips\\r\\nas she paced up and down the borders. Her life at the vicarage was\\r\\ncoming to an end, and she must speak to her father, but after thinking\\r\\nover what she would say for an hour, she could find no words, and came\\r\\nto the conclusion that it would be unwise to open the subject before\\r\\nshe had decided where she was going. Her father would be certain to\\r\\nraise objections, and they would appear more formidable if her plans\\r\\nwere not fixed. It would be better for both of them if the parting were\\r\\nto come suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will go to him in his study,” she said, “when my bag is packed,” and\\r\\nwith this settled in her mind she felt happy for the first time that\\r\\nmorning. She had come out to enjoy the warm spring weather, but, as\\r\\nsoon as she had decided not to speak to her father, and before she had\\r\\ntime to look about her, she saw Maggie waving from the kitchen door and\\r\\nknew that it was time for lunch.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the strain of making plans about her future she found the meal a\\r\\npleasant one, emotion had given her an appetite, and, as she ate, Anne\\r\\nenjoyed listening to her father inveighing against the stupidity of old\\r\\nNoah.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You would scarcely believe it,” said Mr. Dunnock, “but within half an\\r\\nhour of your having scattered the straw, that old fool was sweeping it\\r\\nup. I ordered him to stop, but he would not listen to me until I had\\r\\ntaken him by the arm and had explained my reasons. But so blind is the\\r\\nprejudice of the rustics about here, that he said that he would as soon\\r\\npoison the sparrows as not. I was forced to speak to him very severely.\\r\\nIt is his first lapse since the question of the strawberry nets last\\r\\nyear.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mild sunlit air was full of bees as Anne left the vicarage after\\r\\nlunch; the celandines were gaping in the sunlight on the bank above the\\r\\nBroad Ditch. Wagtails ran round the water’s edge, goldfinches flew up\\r\\ninto the elms, and yellowhammers trotted before her on the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she passed the Post Office she remembered Richard Sotheby and his\\r\\nstrange telegram, and tired of the turmoil of her own emotion, she\\r\\nwelcomed the memory. “I am tired of thy little love affairs and of my\\r\\nown love. I consent. Write.” And pondering over these words she asked\\r\\nherself what kind of creature the Grandison might be to whom they were\\r\\naddressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA rich woman in Paris, it seemed reasonable to suppose, who had\\r\\nbeen his mistress.... “It is to secure her love that little Rachel\\r\\nis neglected.” Anne wondered what their life had been in Paris, and\\r\\nslowly a picture of Miss Grandison formed itself clearly in her mind--a\\r\\nfair woman she must be, with a white skin like the flesh of a hazel\\r\\nnut, with fair almost colourless hair and light blue eyes, a thick,\\r\\nslightly aquiline nose.... That certainly was Miss Grandison, and at\\r\\nthe opera she wore diamonds and was wrapped in white fur. On summer\\r\\nevenings her habit must be to drive with Sotheby out of Paris in her\\r\\nlimousine to have supper in the open air, of lobsters and cream,\\r\\nraspberries and iced champagne.... As the night drew on she would\\r\\nbecome bored, and drag young Sotheby after her to a vast hotel in Paris\\r\\nwhere they could dance all night. The men in their starched shirtfronts\\r\\nwould turn pale, and wilt in the small hours of the morning under the\\r\\ntropical palms, but La Grandison would dance on and on, ruthlessly,\\r\\nfirst with one man and then with another. Richard Sotheby would be\\r\\nforgotten, a young man from the Peruvian Embassy would escort her home,\\r\\nwhile Richard, disconsolate and brokenhearted, would be left to pay for\\r\\nthe buckets of iced champagne, and the mounds of uneaten sandwiches....\\r\\nNo wonder, with such a woman, that he should declare he was weary of\\r\\nher love affairs and of his love. But there was a hint of jealousy in\\r\\nhis bitterness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled contentedly. Richard Sotheby’s telegram enabled her to\\r\\nsee her own life with more philosophy. Soon she forgot to think, and\\r\\nwalked slowly onwards, happy in feeling the soft air caress her cheek,\\r\\nin hearing the chatter of starlings in the orchard trees, in looking\\r\\nabout her in idleness. Ewes lay indolently on the green; their lambs\\r\\nwere already strong on their legs, and she watched the play of the pair\\r\\nnearest to her, at one moment butting each other, in the next skipping\\r\\nbehind each other, or mounting on one another in amorous curvets and\\r\\nthen, suddenly indifferent, breaking off their play.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stream was still swollen, though rain had not fallen for a week.\\r\\nAnne crossed it by the little bridge beside the water splash, and made\\r\\nher way across the green, the sheep scattering as she passed. On each\\r\\nside of the old track that led to the burnt farmhouse, the blackthorn\\r\\nbushes were in flower. The masses of frail blossom were full of the\\r\\nhumming of bees, but as yet there were no wild flowers in the hedge,\\r\\nonly an occasional celandine shone on the bank like a dropped sovereign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fields on each side were hired by a farmer living at a distance;\\r\\nthey were still cultivated and kept in some sort of repair, but much\\r\\nhad gone to ruin since the farmhouse had been burnt. The hedges had\\r\\nnot been cut for years; there were forest trees in them, and holes big\\r\\nenough for bullocks to wander through. The great stretch of pasture by\\r\\nthe farm itself, the home meadows where the prize herd of spotted cows\\r\\nused to be milked in the open, that had gone out of cultivation, and\\r\\nwas full of hawthorn bushes, of the trailing briars of dog-roses and of\\r\\nbrambles. The finest pasture which had yielded the richest butter was\\r\\nbecome no more than a covert where the French partridges nested. Of the\\r\\nfarmhouse itself there was nothing left but a few of the walls, heaps\\r\\nof plaster where the nettles grew in summer, and one or two blackened\\r\\nbeams. The vegetable garden was a wilderness with a quarter of an acre\\r\\nof horseradish and matted gooseberry bushes buried in convolvulvus. At\\r\\none side, on a smooth expanse of turf, stood the old square dove house,\\r\\nas sound as the day it had been built, and the pigeons came and went as\\r\\nthey had always done, for the dove house was still used as a granary,\\r\\nand the pigeons were the perquisite of a farmhand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Anne came in front of the house, it seemed strange to her to see\\r\\nthe fine iron gates, with great ilexes on either side of them, and the\\r\\nflagged path that ran so cleanly up to a mere heap of broken bricks,\\r\\nwhere the front door had been. Not a weed had taken root on the\\r\\npathway, not a bramble strayed across it, and even the pond, by whose\\r\\nbricked side it ran, was clear water. Irises grew there and flowered\\r\\nin the summer time; on the grassy bank opposite there were daffodils\\r\\nin bloom. Anne let herself in at the iron gates, thinking to herself\\r\\nthat it was very strange that no farmhouse had been rebuilt there on\\r\\nthe site of the old one, that no labourer had been allowed to work\\r\\nthe rich garden as his allotment, and that it was impossible to guess\\r\\nwhy everything should have been let go to ruin except the square dove\\r\\nhouse of red brick, which must have stood for three centuries and which\\r\\nlooked as if it would stand for as many more. All about there were\\r\\nthe traces of a former fruitfulness, a great walnut overshadowed one\\r\\nof the ancient yards by the edge of the pond, and on the other side,\\r\\nhidden in an impenetrable thicket of bullaces, giant pear trees and\\r\\nplum suckers, laced about with bramble and dog-rose, was the orchard.\\r\\nThe plums were bursting into a fine blow, and Anne wondered whether the\\r\\nboys came there to rob the fruit, or whether the plums and apples fell\\r\\nof their own weight, or hung until the wasps had hollowed out the last\\r\\nof them. She wondered how it was that she had never met anyone by the\\r\\nBurnt Farm, never a child nor a village labourer. She had not seen it\\r\\nbefore in spring, though in the summer it had been a favourite haunt of\\r\\nhers; and she had gathered roses there late on into the autumn from a\\r\\nbush which had not yet gone wild. As she walked up the path she smelt a\\r\\nbreath of wood smoke, and turning the corner of the house by what had\\r\\nbeen the chimney stack, she saw tongues of flame shooting up, and heard\\r\\nthe crackle of sticks. “A tramp, or perhaps an encampment of gipsies,”\\r\\nshe said to herself, and would have drawn back, but at that instant she\\r\\ncaught sight of Rachel Sotheby coming from the orchard with an armful\\r\\nof dry sticks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, Rachel, are you having a picnic here?” she asked, seeing a kettle\\r\\non the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel came running to her with eyes that shone with excitement; she\\r\\nhad lost her grave look of self-possession, so that it was natural for\\r\\nAnne to stoop to kiss her for the second time, seduced by her wild look\\r\\nand her tangled curls.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Miss Dunnock. Do you come here often? I have never been here\\r\\nbefore, but my brother brought me. He is sketching the house from the\\r\\nother side.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne would have taken her leave on hearing of Richard Sotheby’s\\r\\npresence, but Rachel would not let her go before she had gathered her\\r\\nsome daffodils from the far side of the pond, and had shown her the\\r\\nwhite violets growing under the walnut tree. The kettle had not boiled\\r\\nwhen they came back to the fire, and as Richard Sotheby was nowhere to\\r\\nbe seen, she sat down for a little while, talking to the little girl\\r\\nwhile she heaped up the sticks and unpacked the basket. A minute passed\\r\\nwhen suddenly she heard a step, and, jumping up, saw that Richard\\r\\nSotheby was standing a yard or two behind her. He was bare-headed,\\r\\nfrowning, his lips twitching, and seeing Anne at the same moment as she\\r\\nsaw him, he gave his sister rather a puzzled glance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is my brother Richard,” said Rachel, looking up from blowing the\\r\\nfire. “Richard, this is Miss Dunnock.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man’s face broke into smiles at her name, and he held out his\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am very pleased to meet you,” said Anne, taking it. “Now I must be\\r\\ngetting on. Good-bye, Rachel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please don’t go,” said the grocer’s son. “I have finished work for\\r\\nto-day; the light has changed, and I have been wanting to meet you. I\\r\\nwant to ask you all about how your doorstep was ploughed up. I shall\\r\\nnever meet anyone else to whom such a thing has happened, and I want to\\r\\nknow what it felt like.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was too much taken aback by this to know what to answer, but just\\r\\nat that moment they were interrupted by Rachel’s saying that the tea\\r\\nwas made.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Sotheby repeated his invitation, and Anne sat down on a block of\\r\\nstone which had once supported the corner of a haystack, feeling very\\r\\nfoolish, shy, and ashamed of her shyness, but she was determined that\\r\\nshe would not run away after what he had said. She had blushed crimson\\r\\nwhen he had spoken of Plough Monday, but it had pleased her to hear\\r\\nsomething spoken of openly about which so much must have been said\\r\\nbehind her back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Our doorstep was ploughed up,” she said, and her voice sounded to\\r\\nthe others as though she were angry. “Why does it interest you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was very wicked of the men to do it,” said Rachel suddenly. “And\\r\\nyou ought not to speak of such a thing to Miss Dunnock, Richard.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grocer’s son laughed at his sister’s indignant interruption.\\r\\n“Rachel is a great friend of yours, Miss Dunnock. I shall have to\\r\\napologize to her, but I hope I have not offended you also.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. Not at all. I want to talk about it, Rachel,” she said, looking at\\r\\nthe child. The little girl’s mouth was trembling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That don’t matter,” she said, almost crying. “Richard did not ought to\\r\\nhave spoken to you of that thing. Mother told everyone that what they\\r\\ndone was no better than if they were heathens, and that no one was to\\r\\nsay a word about it. No one would have ever but our Richard.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne took Rachel on to her knees, and hugged the child close; at that\\r\\nmoment she was near to tears herself; for the first time in her life\\r\\nshe understood that she had neighbours who loved her, and did not think\\r\\nof her only as a queer girl, and the daughter of a queer clergyman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sit here, close to me,” she said, letting the child go. “And let me\\r\\ntalk to your brother, because he is very clever and is....” It was on\\r\\nthe tip of her tongue to say “a gentleman,” but she altered it to:\\r\\n“because I am sure he would never be unkind.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel looked at him in a way which threatened that if he were unkind\\r\\nto Miss Dunnock there would be terrible consequences, and Richard\\r\\nSotheby poured out the tea in silence, until Anne asked him again why\\r\\nhe was interested in the ploughing up of the doorstep.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because it was, as my mother said, a heathenish act, and I imagine\\r\\nthat, like most heathen things, it must have been beautiful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it was beautiful,” replied Anne instantly. “It was so beautiful\\r\\nthat I was fascinated watching it, and though I was crying with shame,\\r\\nI was glad that they had done it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Sotheby grinned with interest as Anne said this, and nodded his\\r\\nhead several times.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Like a rape,” he said under his breath. His words were not meant for\\r\\nAnne to hear, but she had caught the word, and for some minutes did not\\r\\nknow what to say or where to look, but sat praying with all her soul\\r\\nthat she would not blush. At last the danger passed, and she went on\\r\\nto speak of the plough wobbling a little as it ran through the earth,\\r\\nand of the broad, shiny backs of the three chestnut horses, and the\\r\\nhandsome face opposite her quickened with pleasure as she told how it\\r\\nhappened after a fall of snow, and that there was snow on the horses’\\r\\nmanes and on the carters’ caps.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had described the whole scene, he pressed her for further\\r\\ndetails, and soon she found that she was speaking of her feelings after\\r\\nthe event, and that he was listening in silence. She pulled herself up\\r\\nsuddenly, unwilling to tell him so much about herself, and there was\\r\\na long silence, for the young man did not press her with questions,\\r\\nbut the silence was broken at last by Anne saying: “But you cannot\\r\\nunderstand it unless I were to tell you about my father.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course it came about through him in the first place,” said Richard\\r\\nSotheby reflectively, and Anne would have begun to speak of her father\\r\\nand her feelings for him if she had not felt Rachel shiver, and then\\r\\nshe perceived that the sun was sinking low, and that it had grown cold\\r\\nfor sitting out of doors.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is too long a story,” she said, rising to her feet. “You would\\r\\nnot understand it, and if you did, it would bore you. But it is late\\r\\nnow, and I must be going home.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must promise to tell me another time,” said the grocer’s son. “If\\r\\nthe weather keeps fine I shall be working here every afternoon, until\\r\\nabout half-past three when the light changes. Come and have tea with me\\r\\nto-morrow and finish your story.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne promised to come, and then gathering up her flowers and saying\\r\\ngood-bye to Rachel, she hurried off, for young Sotheby had to go back\\r\\nto his easel and put it away in the dove house, and she had no wish to\\r\\nbe seen walking home with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEIGHT: WILLOW-PATTERN PARIS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several days a gentle wind blew from the west and the cloudiness\\r\\nof dew-drenched mornings was followed by the sunshine and softness of\\r\\nthe afternoons. Anne Dunnock knew that the grocer’s son was painting\\r\\nat the Burnt Farm, but though each day she set out in that direction,\\r\\nshe always turned aside on the way, breaking her promise that she would\\r\\nmeet him there again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I spoke to him too freely; Heaven knows what he must think of me!” she\\r\\nrepeated to herself. At moments she found it consoling to remember that\\r\\nshe felt quite sure that she did not like Richard Sotheby, but at other\\r\\ntimes it seemed to her that what was so terrible was to have confided\\r\\nso much of her secret life to a man whom she disliked. But the weather\\r\\nwas too beautiful for her to remain long unhappy for such reasons, and\\r\\nnearly her whole day was spent out of doors. In the morning she would\\r\\nbusy herself in the garden, and, tempted by the sunshine, Mr. Dunnock\\r\\nwould leave his study to come and stand beside her while she sowed the\\r\\nsweet peas and the mignonette, or planted out young wallflowers in the\\r\\nborders.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do not forget to sow teazles by the pond,” he would remind her. “They\\r\\nare as handsome as hollyhocks, and wherever there have been teazles in\\r\\nsummer time the goldfinches will come in winter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne did not regard the teazle as a weed, she loved the plant’s bold\\r\\nleaves that hold hands about the prickly stem, making a cup to catch\\r\\nthe rain, and the flower-heads with their bands of blue which creep up\\r\\nand down the inflorescence.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew words passed between father and daughter, yet both were happy as\\r\\nthey went together to sow the teazle seed that he had saved, and were\\r\\nconscious of being in sympathy with one another as they had scarcely\\r\\nbeen all the winter. Once there was a rose tree to be transplanted; on\\r\\nanother occasion a rambler which had been blown down had to be nailed\\r\\nup on the far side of the summer-house, and while Anne shovelled the\\r\\nearth round the roots, and drove the nails through strips cut from an\\r\\nold stair carpet, Mr. Dunnock held the tree upright and the creeper in\\r\\nplace, his hands protected in Noah’s hedging gloves.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The bees are working in the willows,” he said. “Though it is still\\r\\nthree weeks to Palm Sunday.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Anne had not abandoned her plan; it was only that the spring and\\r\\nthe garden full of growing things had claimed her attention. But one\\r\\nmorning she found a letter for her on the breakfast table, and as she\\r\\nopened it her heart sank, for she guessed that it was from a lady\\r\\nanxious to engage her as a companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What am I to say to him?” she asked herself, looking up at her father\\r\\nas he came into the room, and the morning was spent wandering about\\r\\nthe house, first carrying an old trunk out of the box-room to pack her\\r\\nthings, and then with pale cheeks running to the door of her father’s\\r\\nstudy. She did not knock, when she stood trembling outside the door,\\r\\nthough she knew that in a day or two at most, perhaps even in a few\\r\\nhours, she would be leaving the vicarage.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring luncheon she came nearest to speaking to her father, but each\\r\\ntime, just as she was going to begin, she was interrupted by some\\r\\nremark of his. Such a subject could not be opened without preparation,\\r\\nwhen her father spoke of the decoration of the church at Easter her\\r\\ncourage failed her, and before she had recovered it, he had shaken the\\r\\ncrumbs off his waistcoat and had gone into his study.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall have to leave a letter for him to read after I am gone,” said\\r\\nAnne, but the idea was hateful to her; it revealed her own cowardice\\r\\ntoo clearly, and when she began to compose the letter that should be\\r\\nleft behind, she found the task an impossible one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A walk will help me to think things out,” but in the road her\\r\\nfootsteps turned of themselves across the green, and she was half-way\\r\\nto the Burnt Farm before she stopped suddenly, realizing that she was\\r\\ngoing there to lay her difficulties before the grocer’s son.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That will be the best way,” she said aloud. “In such a position as\\r\\nmine, one must seek advice, for it is only when one has been advised by\\r\\nsomeone else that one recovers confidence in the sanity of one’s own\\r\\nopinions.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDirectly she had passed through the iron gates the sunshine seemed\\r\\nwarmer; it was as hot as June; she could see the daffodils clustering\\r\\non the banks of the pond and reflected in its waters; a brimstone\\r\\nbutterfly rose from the flagged pathway and rambled in front of her,\\r\\nsettling at last on one of the brick walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a continuous cooing from the top of the dove house, and the\\r\\nbeat of the wings of the pigeons coming and going; a blackbird was\\r\\nsinging in the tangled orchard.\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel Sotheby was nowhere to be seen; there was no fire burning, but\\r\\nrecollecting that Richard Sotheby would be painting on the other side\\r\\nof the house, Anne walked round into the wild garden. She could not see\\r\\nhim, and soon sat down, putting her arms up to tidy her hair, loosened\\r\\nby an angry toss of her head, for she was vexed to have come looking\\r\\nfor the young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please stay like that,” said a sharp voice behind her, and she looked\\r\\nround to find Richard Sotheby watching her from inside the ruined walls.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please stay where you are, Miss Dunnock,” he repeated. “You are\\r\\nexactly what I want in my picture; I knew there was something\\r\\nneeded;--now I see that it is a figure.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Anne jumped up before the sentence was finished, and Richard\\r\\nSotheby climbed out of the ruin with his palette in his hand and a\\r\\nfrown on his face, repeating, “Please stay there....”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was insistent, and Anne had to agree to sit for a few minutes while\\r\\nhe made a charcoal drawing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I have finished you shall have tea,” he said as though he were\\r\\nspeaking to a child. Anne sat, looking up at the sky with her hands to\\r\\nher hair and her elbows up, as he had posed her, saying to herself that\\r\\nshe had never met anyone with such bad manners.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was hot with annoyance, but soon the blush left her cheek, and\\r\\nwhile she listened to the pigeons her resentment faded away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“May I see your picture?” she asked five minutes later, and when the\\r\\nartist refused, shaking his head and laughing, she felt no irritation.\\r\\nIt seemed natural to her that he should say: “Not till it is finished.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When will that be?” she asked, remembering her own departure.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will take me a week to put in that figure; I don’t know how I shall\\r\\ndo it unless you sit for me. Come, let us have tea.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid I cannot sit, Mr. Sotheby,” said Anne. “I have come to-day\\r\\nto say good-bye.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man opened his eyes at this; his curiosity had to be\\r\\nsatisfied, and soon Anne was telling him that her life was being wasted\\r\\nat the vicarage, and that she was determined to leave her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Sotheby listened without saying a word; he was kneeling in\\r\\nfront of the little fire he had just lighted. The sticks smouldered\\r\\nbut went out when the paper had burnt away, and she paused in her\\r\\nstory while he fetched a bottle of turpentine from his paint-box. He\\r\\nsprinkled a little of the spirit, and a thick yellow flame sprang up;\\r\\nthen the sticks crackled. All his attention seemed to be for the fire,\\r\\nonly when she spoke of the advertisement he turned his head sharply to\\r\\nlook at her, and when she told him that an answer had come that morning\\r\\nhe exclaimed: “Extraordinary!” under his breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what does your father say to all this?” he asked suddenly, as he\\r\\nhanded her the cup of tea he had poured out. Anne found the confession\\r\\nof her cowardice was difficult; Sotheby was staring at her as if he\\r\\nwere surprised by her words.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that would be behaving very heartlessly,” he said when she had\\r\\ndone. He filled the lid of the kettle with tea, blew on it and added:\\r\\n“It would be a great shock to him, and it seems to me so unnecessary.\\r\\nChildren have parents so much at their mercy; their one duty to them,\\r\\nsurely, is to avoid shattering their illusions. I’m not a good son;\\r\\nmy father is excessively irritating; quite as irritating as yours. I\\r\\ndon’t love him, and that makes me feel ashamed.... You have left it so\\r\\nlate.... Do you really think that getting this place is worth having to\\r\\nbehave so badly?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s face fell, and rather sulkily she pulled the letter she had got\\r\\nthat morning out of her pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Sotheby glanced at it, wrinkled his nose, and began reading it\\r\\naloud:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                     “Spion Kop,”\\r\\n                                      14A Kimberley Road,\\r\\n                                         West Sutton Vallance,\\r\\n                                                           London, W.23.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Dear Madam,\\r\\n\\r\\n  I have seen your advertisement in _The Church Times_, and think it\\r\\n  possible that you may suit me. I am looking for a companion of gentle\\r\\n  birth who would be willing to undertake light duties in the house.\\r\\n  I have a girl who comes in daily. What I really require is someone\\r\\n  who will, as far as possible, take the place of my own devoted and\\r\\n  dearly-loved daughter who died last year after a long illness,\\r\\n  patiently borne.\\r\\n\\r\\n  I would introduce you to a pleasant circle of friends, and would look\\r\\n  after you as, I think you will agree, a girl should be looked after\\r\\n  on coming so near London. I cannot offer a high wage, but you will\\r\\n  have every home comfort. Will you please tell me in your answer,\\r\\n  your age, and whether you have been away from home before, and when\\r\\n  you can come up for me to interview you. It is essential that you\\r\\n  should be fond of dogs, but no doubt you are. This neighbourhood is\\r\\n  considered a very healthy one, and the house is next door to the\\r\\n  church.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                               Yours faithfully,\\r\\n                                                         ETHEL CROWLINK.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach phrase had sounded comic as he read it aloud, and his voice ended\\r\\nwith such a queer note that Anne burst out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You think I oughtn’t to go to her?” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is ridiculous to think of it,” he answered. “Not for your father’s\\r\\nsake but for your own. It would be out of the frying-pan into the fire:\\r\\nsurely you see that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not answer, and he went on: “Why should you choose to live with\\r\\nthe horrid old woman who wrote this letter, in a London suburb? If you\\r\\nmust leave home....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must....” she said. “Better anything, however horrid it may sound.\\r\\nIf I do not get away from home, I shall never be able to speak to\\r\\nanyone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a long silence while she watched Richard Sotheby wrinkling up\\r\\nhis nose.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may be more unhappy when you can speak, Anne. Particularly if you\\r\\nshould fall in love. That makes one more unhappy than anything else.\\r\\nHowever, you would do better to go as an English governess in a French\\r\\nfamily. In that way you would see new people and have quite fresh\\r\\nexperiences.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Richard Sotheby began to speak of Paris, while Anne sat fascinated\\r\\nby the magic flow of words, seeing pictures of a great town full of\\r\\navenues and open spaces, with a twisting river, crossed by innumerable\\r\\nbridges. And for some reason, though she knew that Paris was a huge\\r\\ncity, and though Richard spoke often of the crowds thronging the\\r\\nboulevards, she imagined Paris as a willow-pattern plate; its bridges\\r\\nlike that steep bridge over which a blue figure is hurrying, with\\r\\nbald-headed Chinamen fishing in the winding river beside it on which\\r\\na barge is floating, a lady is disembarking, and weeping willow trees\\r\\nborder the Elysian fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voice went on, Anne watching the fine forehead and the abstracted\\r\\neyes gazing into the fire, was carried away by her imagination and saw\\r\\nherself living in the willow-pattern city.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That will be wonderful,” she said. “But what am I to say in my letter\\r\\nto Mrs. Crowlink?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke in a tone of such despair that he burst out laughing at her.\\r\\n“You are a child!” he said, but his voice was too pleasant for her to\\r\\ntake offence, and for the first time she knew the sweetness of being\\r\\nlaughed at without minding it. “I feel sure of his sympathy,” she said\\r\\nto herself. “Though I came here believing that I disliked him, and even\\r\\nnow I am not sure what I think of him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Sotheby had gathered his brushes together, and was pouring\\r\\nwater from the kettle on to the ashes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will come and sit to me to-morrow, won’t you?” he asked. “And then\\r\\nwe can go on with our discussion of your future. Come at half-past two,\\r\\nbut now we had better go home separately, otherwise we shall see our\\r\\nnames written up on Lambert’s Barn: ‘Richard Sotheby loves Anne Dunnock\\r\\nand takes her to the Burnt Farm.’ I wonder if they would put ‘the dirty\\r\\ndog,’ or ‘bless his heart,’ after my name? It is usually one or the\\r\\nother.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed at this, and looked the grocer’s son in the eyes, but his\\r\\nglance was one of mere amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, they would put ‘the dirty dog’ after your name,” she said suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are quite right,” he said laughing. “Wonderful you should guess.”\\r\\nHe did not offer to shake hands, and she walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had read the scrawls chronicling the loves of the village boys and\\r\\ngirls, but she had never thought that it would be possible to speak\\r\\nof them. As she hurried home her heart was beating fast; she looked\\r\\nneither to left nor right, but kept repeating to herself: “Richard\\r\\nSotheby loves Anne Dunnock, the dirty dog!” “But he doesn’t,” she\\r\\nadded, wondering if she would wish to be loved by him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she repeated as a variation: “Richard Sotheby doesn’t love Anne\\r\\nDunnock, the dirty dog!” That was more like the truth! And she thought\\r\\nof the telegram she had seen him write, and wondered if he would\\r\\ntell her about La Grandison. Perhaps one day soon she would see her,\\r\\nalighting from a barge in the Seine that ran through a willow-pattern\\r\\nParis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no other answers to her advertisement, and as soon as the\\r\\nlying letter to Mrs. Crowlink had been posted, Anne was free to forget\\r\\nher problems. The week which followed passed happily enough; every\\r\\nafternoon she sat for an hour or more in the spring sunlight talking to\\r\\nRichard Sotheby while he painted her, answering his questions about her\\r\\nchildhood at Ely, describing the poverty in which they had lived, and\\r\\nhow her mother had been looked down upon by the ladies of the cathedral\\r\\nset, then telling him of her father’s eccentricities, and his violent\\r\\ntemper, and of the last outburst when he had insulted a canon, and had\\r\\nbeen sent for by the Bishop, and of how he had been kept to lunch at\\r\\nthe palace and sent away with the words: “I think you will do better by\\r\\nyourself, Mr. Dunnock. There is a living going begging at Dry Coulter.\\r\\nA hundred and twenty pounds a year....”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pigeons cooed through all the afternoon, the pear tree burst into\\r\\nflower over her head, and was filled with the hum of hundreds of bees\\r\\nworking among the scarlet stamens, at intervals Anne spoke of her life,\\r\\nand every now and then Richard would interrupt her with questions\\r\\nabout her father. When she told of his love for the birds, Richard was\\r\\ndelighted, and the rest of the afternoon was spent describing all his\\r\\nlittle acts of tenderness and consideration: scattering straw for the\\r\\nsparrows to build their nests, sowing teazles for the goldfinches....\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see that I should get on much better with your father than you do,”\\r\\nhe said. “We should have a great deal in common.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has made me hate birds,” said Anne. “Sometimes I think I should\\r\\nlike to wear a bird in my hat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You feel about birds what I feel about love and about religion, I\\r\\nsuppose,” said Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My father has got birds and religion all mixed up, somehow,” said\\r\\nAnne, but when he asked her to explain, all she could say was: “I don’t\\r\\nunderstand it, and I can’t explain it, but I know I am right. It is\\r\\ndifficult to tell often of which he is speaking.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That seems rather a beautiful confusion to me,” said Richard. “Just\\r\\nlisten for a moment to the pigeons in the dove house and you will feel\\r\\ninclined to it yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I only hate them because I am wicked and selfish,” said Anne. “I am\\r\\nnot going to sacrifice all my life to beautiful things. Father can only\\r\\nsee beauty in a chaffinch or a wagtail; I might be beautiful too, but\\r\\nhe would never notice it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard laughed at this outburst. “As pretty as a wagtail,” he mused,\\r\\nscrewing up his eyes, and teasing her. “That is flying rather high,\\r\\nisn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t see why a human being shouldn’t be as beautiful as a bird,”\\r\\nsaid Anne seriously, at which her companion laughed more than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps not,” he said. “Still you don’t really hope that anyone should\\r\\never say to you: ‘Miss Dunnock, you are as pretty as a hedge-sparrow.’\\r\\nI, of course, with my long nose, am rather like a snipe.” Then,\\r\\nchanging his tone, he went on: “You are more like a heron than a\\r\\nhedge-sparrow: a tall ghostly figure seen by moonlight standing in the\\r\\nreeds at the water’s edge. The heron’s hair is always flying loose like\\r\\nyours; he tries in vain to keep it up with fish bones.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am going to cut all my hair off!” cried Anne savagely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I think you would look better,” said Richard simply. “But you\\r\\nmust not do that until my picture is finished. Seriously, if you want\\r\\nadmiration, you should come to Paris. You are quite sure to find\\r\\nsomeone there who will think you are beautiful.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bit her lip, and asked herself if Richard could have told her more\\r\\nplainly, to her face, that he did not think so.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He does not care for me,” she said to herself as she walked home the\\r\\nfollowing afternoon, after the last sitting. “Had he cared for me, he\\r\\nwould have said something nice to me when he said good-bye. He is only\\r\\namused, and contemptuous. Thank Heaven I did not show him any of my\\r\\ndrawings!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor she had taken out her drawing book that morning, to try her hand\\r\\nat fashion plates, and had sat a long while examining her old careful\\r\\nsketches of a dead-nettle in flower and a spray of honeysuckle in bud,\\r\\nonly to put them away at last guessing that her work would not make\\r\\nRichard Sotheby take her any more seriously, though an ambition to earn\\r\\nher living by drawing clothes was still present in her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yet he likes me, I am sure of that,” she said. “He would not tease me\\r\\notherwise.” The thought consoled her, and she crossed the green more\\r\\nhappily. Suddenly she heard a little cry behind her, a sharp note like\\r\\nthe clink of flint on steel, and looking round she saw Rachel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you come to tea to-morrow?” the child asked when she had\\r\\novertaken her. “It is my birthday and mother told me I might ask anyone\\r\\nthat I liked.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNINE: BIRTHDAY TEA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne sat down to tea on the following afternoon, with the four\\r\\nSothebys, round an iced cake with thirteen candles, in the rather\\r\\ndark little room where she had retired to hide her tears after Plough\\r\\nMonday, darker now, for it was raining outside. There were chocolate\\r\\nbiscuits in glass dishes and crackers lying on the table between the\\r\\nplates. But in spite of the air of jollity, and of Rachel’s excitement,\\r\\nAnne felt just as she had done on the first occasion she had entered\\r\\nthe room: anxious to escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel had met her at the door, they had kissed, and she had given\\r\\nthe little girl a pair of fur-lined slippers as a birthday present,\\r\\nbut immediately afterwards Mrs. Sotheby had begun to introduce her\\r\\nto Richard and he had no sooner cut his mother short by saying that\\r\\nthey were acquainted already, when the grocer came up and said: “Miss\\r\\nDunnock, this is my son Richard of whom I think I have spoken to\\r\\nyou....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Miss Dunnock and I have met,” said Richard, and Anne added: “Richard\\r\\nand I are old friends already,” but at once became aware that what she\\r\\nsaid was the wrong thing, for there was an expression of astonishment,\\r\\nalmost of alarm, possibly even of disapproval, on Mr. Sotheby’s face.\\r\\nCertainly he seemed nervous as he said: “Well, well, since I find we\\r\\nare all acquainted let us sit down to tea.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difficulties of the introduction were forgotten in the excitement\\r\\nof cutting the cake, and it was not long before the last of the\\r\\ncrackers was pulled; a yellow paper crown was found for Mr. Sotheby;\\r\\nthere were paper caps for the rest of the company, and though several\\r\\nof the mottoes alluded to Christmas, they were read aloud with pleasure\\r\\nand received with delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is too bad, Richard,” said Mr. Sotheby over his third cup of tea.\\r\\n“You are going away the day after to-morrow, and you have never painted\\r\\nthe portrait of your mother, for which I have asked so often.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne felt numb on hearing that Richard was going away in two days’\\r\\ntime: “Why didn’t he tell me that?” she asked herself, but without\\r\\nnoticing her look the grocer went on: “You have spent all your time out\\r\\nsketching the old manor house, but you have not shown us any of your\\r\\nwork.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He brought it back to-day,” said Mrs. Sotheby. “But I haven’t seen\\r\\nit.” Richard was reluctant to show his picture, but at last he left\\r\\nthe room, and it was only then, seeing Rachel was trembling, and upset\\r\\nabout something, that Anne suddenly remembered that the Sothebys might\\r\\neasily recognize the figure of the girl in the foreground, engaged in\\r\\ndoing up her hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard lifted an eyebrow at her as he put the canvas on the\\r\\nmantelpiece, and there was a long silence, a silence which grew\\r\\nalarming, and Anne knew that she had been recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This figure is you, Miss Dunnock,” said the grocer at last, speaking\\r\\nstiffly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Miss Dunnock came by while I was making tea for Richard,” said Rachel\\r\\nin her precise tone, and everyone in the room breathed more freely.\\r\\n“She stayed to tea with us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And she was good enough to pose for me while I drew a sketch of her to\\r\\nput into the foreground,” said Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was very kind of you, to be sure,” said his father.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself, Richard,” said Mrs.\\r\\nSotheby. “Putting Miss Dunnock into your horrid picture like that; you\\r\\nhaven’t done her justice at all. I should scarcely have recognized\\r\\nher.” And the grocer’s wife gave Anne a little smile to tell her that\\r\\nshe did not mind Richard’s having painted her instead of the portrait\\r\\nthat his father wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should never have sat to him,” said Anne, “if I had known that he\\r\\nought to have been painting your portrait,” but Mr. Sotheby was saying\\r\\nthat he had to be off on business.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very, very kind of you to come on Rachel’s birthday,” he said as he\\r\\nleft the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, indeed, there is hardly any resemblance at all,” said Mrs.\\r\\nSotheby. “Anyone might think it was one of the Puttys come home again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who are the Puttys?” asked Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, you don’t mean to say that you have never heard of the Puttys!”\\r\\nexclaimed Rachel and her mother together, and Richard, who had been\\r\\nlooking glum since he had shown his picture, added: “Yes, you ought to\\r\\nhear that story, since you are the only other person that has turned\\r\\nthe ploughmen away.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can you say such a thing, Richard!” said Mrs. Sotheby. “You know\\r\\nhow that came about by mistake,” but Anne asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did the Puttys have their doorstep ploughed up?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, not the Puttys,” was the answer, and as Anne seemed mystified but\\r\\neager to hear more Richard said: “Come, mother, tell Miss Dunnock the\\r\\nwhole story from the beginning.” And Rachel also added her request for\\r\\nthe story.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, wait a moment till I have cleared away the tea-things,” said\\r\\nMrs. Sotheby, work that was soon done with both Rachel and Anne\\r\\nhelping. While they were out of the room Richard seized the opportunity\\r\\nto take his canvas off the mantelpiece. He hid it in the woodshed and\\r\\ncame back feeling happier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chairs were drawn up round the fire, Rachel sitting at Anne’s knee\\r\\nand holding her hand, and Mrs. Sotheby began:\\r\\n\\r\\n“What you children call the ‘Burnt Farm’ is really the ruins of a manor\\r\\nhouse; the squire lived there, Captain Purdue, and since the burning\\r\\nthere has been no squire at Dry Coulter. I can remember him very well:\\r\\na tall man who had been a captain in the navy, and he certainly thought\\r\\na great deal about appearances. One could tell that just by looking at\\r\\nhim; what one could not have told was that he cared a great deal about\\r\\nmoney too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have forgotten to say that he had been dismissed the service,”\\r\\nRichard reminded his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, his ship was wrecked, you know, and he left the navy after that;\\r\\nI have heard that he was turned out because of it, but I do not really\\r\\nknow,” said Mrs. Sotheby. “Certainly he was a very unlucky man, but at\\r\\nfirst all went well; he had a fine house, built in the time of King\\r\\nCharles II (Oliver’s men had burnt the old house down in the civil\\r\\nwars), and a wonderful garden (he had a whole greenhouse full of arum\\r\\nlilies in the winter), his horses were famous, and his dairy cows won\\r\\nprizes. At that time there was not a gentleman’s place for miles round\\r\\nthat was kept up better. But I should have said that Captain Purdue\\r\\nwas married, to a very good-looking lady indeed. She was a good deal\\r\\nyounger than he was, and I think she came from the Channel Islands. But\\r\\nthey had no children.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was the jangle of the shop bell. Mrs. Sotheby broke off her\\r\\nsentence and started to her feet, but Rachel had slipped out into the\\r\\nshop before her, and they could hear a woman saying that she had just\\r\\nrun across for a bar of soap, and then, when she had made her purchase,\\r\\nask: “It is your birthday, isn’t it, Rachel? Many happy returns!\\r\\nHow does it feel to be grown up?” and the little girl answer: “Very\\r\\npleasant indeed, thank you very much, Mrs. Papworth.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The first of the Captain’s misfortunes,” continued Mrs. Sotheby, “was\\r\\nthat his wife ran away from him, and it was not long after that before\\r\\nhe was killed in an accident. He was having his barn altered; it was\\r\\nan old building, nearly as old as the house, and he wanted to make it\\r\\na couple of feet higher and was having the roof raised on jacks. They\\r\\ngot one side of it up some inches, and then the foreman sent for him to\\r\\ntell him that it couldn’t be done. The Captain went to see for himself\\r\\nbut he would not listen to anything the men said, but gave the word to\\r\\ngo on with the work, and they had not given the screws on the other\\r\\nside half a dozen turns before the main beam broke in two and the whole\\r\\nroof fell in on them. Captain Purdue was standing just underneath, and\\r\\nwas killed, and three of the men were badly injured. You see it was no\\r\\none’s fault but his own, and indeed it was very lucky that others were\\r\\nnot killed beside himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how did the house get burnt, and what had the ploughmen to do with\\r\\nit?” asked Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing at all,” answered Mrs. Sotheby with a laugh. “But some of the\\r\\nmost ignorant of the men said that his bad luck was because they had\\r\\nploughed the doorstep up. That’s why it was so wrong of them to behave\\r\\nlike that to your father if they really believe what they say. But I\\r\\ndon’t think they do believe such things nowadays: everyone laughs at\\r\\nthem, but I think people will do anything if it is the custom.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So they are expecting us to have bad luck?” asked Anne with her face\\r\\nsuddenly serious.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard looked at her rather maliciously and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, we all expect you to run away from home and your father to fall\\r\\nout of a tree and break his neck while he is putting a young bird back\\r\\ninto its nest.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard laughed at this while his mother exclaimed: “How dare you talk\\r\\nlike that, Richard!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is only being a tease,” said Rachel, looking up at Anne. “I have\\r\\ngot used to it now, and pay no attention to him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Finish the story, mother,” said Richard, and Anne added her voice to\\r\\nhis. “Please finish the story. I am waiting to hear how the house was\\r\\nburnt down. Then I shall go home and buy some fire extinguishers.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all laughed at this, and Mrs. Sotheby continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n“After Captain Purdue’s death it was nearly a year before the lawyers\\r\\ncould find the heirs to the estate, and when they did find them the\\r\\ntrouble was to know what to do with them. They called themselves Putty,\\r\\nthough the name was really Purdue; the father and mother were dead and\\r\\nthere were two brothers and two sisters. They had lived all their lives\\r\\nin a tumble-down cottage without proper windows or doors, right out on\\r\\nthe Bedford Level, miles from anywhere. The brothers were labourers,\\r\\nditchers. The elder of the two was called Jack: he was the best of the\\r\\nfamily but it was difficult to make out what he said. There was no\\r\\ngetting anything out of his brother; he was stone deaf and had a cleft\\r\\npalate. The girls were very wild, dirty creatures, and not quite right\\r\\nin the head. When they were sober they were all like wooden images,\\r\\nand they looked very queer when they first came, in the black clothes\\r\\nMr. Stott had bought for them. Well, they moved into the house, and\\r\\nwithin a week all the servants left and they were alone there. None of\\r\\nthe gentry round would have anything to do with them; nobody went near\\r\\nthe house except Dr. Boulder and Mr. Noble, who was the vicar here in\\r\\nthose days, and of course Mr. Stott, the lawyer. At first they lived\\r\\nvery quietly, only making a fearful mess of the three rooms they used.\\r\\nThey were afraid that Mr. Stott could turn them out if he had wanted\\r\\nto, but after they had been there two or three months they grew more\\r\\nconfident. And though they were like images if there were other people\\r\\nabout, there was plenty of noise when they were by themselves and when\\r\\nthey were drunk. Jack used to throw things and his sisters would throw\\r\\nthings back. At first they came to ‘The Red Cow’ for drink, and Jack\\r\\nused sometimes to wave Captain Purdue’s hunting crop and threaten to\\r\\nhorsewhip anybody who didn’t take his hat off, and one day when he had\\r\\ngot very drunk he stood by the monument on the green and made a speech.\\r\\nPeople could hear him bellowing for miles round, but no one could make\\r\\nout much of what he said except that he was the squire, and that he\\r\\nought to have been told before, and that he would never be rough with\\r\\nanybody.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One day when he was in ‘The Red Cow’ one of the men asked him how it\\r\\nwas that he didn’t like port wine. That was the first Jack had heard\\r\\nof Captain Purdue’s cellar, for, would you believe it, the Puttys had\\r\\nnever been all over the house, and the cellar being locked up they had\\r\\nnot troubled to break it open. After they found the wine nothing was\\r\\nseen of them for more than a week and then, one night, we were all\\r\\nwoken up with the news that the manor house had caught fire. Everyone\\r\\nin the village turned out to help and the fire engine was fetched from\\r\\nLinton, but it came too late to be any use. The whole house was ablaze\\r\\nwhen we got there; the dairy and stables too, for they were touching\\r\\nthe house. The men had made a line from the pond and were passing\\r\\nbuckets, but it did no good, for the rooms were very old-fashioned and\\r\\nall the panelling had caught alight by that time, and the staircase\\r\\ntoo. The flames made it as light as day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What about the Puttys?” asked Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that was a very dreadful story. Jack Putty had just broken his\\r\\nway out of the house when we got there, but the two girls and the\\r\\ndeaf brother were still inside. One of the Peck boys, who went to Wet\\r\\nCoulter afterwards as a ploughman, got out both of the girls, but they\\r\\nwere terribly burned, and the brother lost his life. Jack Putty did not\\r\\nseem to understand what was happening at first, but when the fire had\\r\\ntaken hold of everything he missed his brother, and then he ran back\\r\\ninto the house to find him. He came out again with his clothes alight\\r\\nand jumped into the pond, and then, when he got out, he ran back into\\r\\nthe fire again. It was dreadful to see that. He got out alive a second\\r\\ntime, and would have gone in a third time, but everyone could see it\\r\\nwas no use, and they prevented him; it took four men to hold him. Poor\\r\\nfellow, his feet were terribly burned, but he didn’t seem to mind\\r\\nthat, but kept crying out that he must save his brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After that they were all taken to the hospital, and there they found\\r\\nout that the girls were not fit to be about, so they were sent to an\\r\\nasylum for the imbecile. They have been there ever since, but Jack\\r\\nPutty seemed a different man after that. He went out to Australia; Mr.\\r\\nStott sends him his rent regularly, and Jack sent him word when he got\\r\\nmarried. The property still belongs to him, of course, and that is how\\r\\nit is that the manor house has never been rebuilt.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a silence in the little parlour, while they turned the story\\r\\nover in their minds. Mrs. Sotheby began to poke up the fire in the\\r\\ngrate, and the flames shot up; they had been sitting almost in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A wonderful story,” said Richard. “I often think of Jack Putty as a\\r\\nmodel: a man who was really able to love his brother as himself. That\\r\\nis the only sort of love, love which will sacrifice everything, put up\\r\\nwith everything, yet ask for nothing in return. Selfish love is misery,\\r\\nI suppose it deserves to be, but how does one avoid it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you think Jack Putty felt unselfish love?” Anne asked, feeling\\r\\nrather puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t think he tried to go back into the fire for the third time\\r\\nbecause it was gentlemanly, do you? though I’ve no doubt he really was\\r\\na gentleman,” answered Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You would not have thought Jack Putty was a gentleman if you had seen\\r\\nhim,” said his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I daresay not, but I should have been wrong ... he was fearless, and\\r\\nhe was independent,” said Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He certainly was not a biddable man,” said Mrs. Sotheby. “But that was\\r\\nthe only thing he had in common with his second cousin, Captain Purdue.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Peck boy went in once, to rescue the two girls, but I should\\r\\nnot have gone in at all. I don’t think I should go into a burning\\r\\nhouse even if you or Rachel were inside it. I’m sure if Ginette ...\\r\\nGrandison.... But it’s not a proof of love at all; some people will\\r\\nrisk their lives to save a kitten.” He muttered something else, but the\\r\\nothers could not catch it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must be going,” said Anne, getting up. “Gracious me, it is past six\\r\\no’clock.” And thanking Mrs. Sotheby for her story and kissing Rachel,\\r\\nshe hurried back through the rain to the vicarage to prepare supper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTEN: NO GOOD-BYES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was morning before Anne could find any sleep, and the hours she\\r\\nspent lying in the darkness with her eyes open, or sometimes standing\\r\\nat her bedroom window gazing out at the pale lawn and the moony spaces\\r\\nof the orchard beyond, listening to the whispering notes of the little\\r\\nowls, and to the weather-vane on the dove house, whimpering as it\\r\\nswung in the wind: those hours were remembered afterwards as the most\\r\\nmiserable of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What have I done?” she asked herself, but she could find nothing in\\r\\nher own conduct to explain Richard’s behaviour. “If he regarded me with\\r\\neven the interest of a casual acquaintance he must have told me of his\\r\\ndeparture. He would have said something, surely. Even if he hates me he\\r\\nwould have spoken of when he was going away.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Richard had not mentioned it, and had it not been for a chance\\r\\nremark of Mr. Sotheby’s she would have known nothing of the matter. “He\\r\\nmust have intended to hide it from me,” she said, wondering why it\\r\\nshould be hidden and asking herself if it was because he was afraid of\\r\\ntelling her, or because he had fancied that she was in love with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, he has no such thoughts,” she assured herself. “It is because of\\r\\nhis complete indifference to me. His whole mind is occupied by Ginette\\r\\nGrandison.” And suddenly, a new thought striking her, she said aloud\\r\\nand almost joyfully: “Who knows what unhappiness she may be causing\\r\\nhim?” The thought of Richard’s pain was a comfort to her, and she\\r\\nwondered once more what the woman could be like who had so enslaved him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I seem sometimes in my thoughts to assume that I am in love with\\r\\nRichard myself,” she said to herself with surprise. “But indeed I don’t\\r\\nlove him. He is hateful; when I am with him I know well enough that we\\r\\ncould never by any chance love each other. He is as sharp as his own\\r\\nnose; he has no feelings that I can understand. But yet I am fond of\\r\\nhim, for he is the first man to whom I have been able to speak freely,\\r\\nthe first man. How I long to live in a world of such men. To live in\\r\\nParis.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently her thoughts turned from Richard and his cruel behaviour, to\\r\\nthink of her own life and what it would become.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should have escaped from here by now had it not been for him,” she\\r\\nsaid bitterly, and then, recollecting that there had been no more\\r\\nanswers to her advertisement, she wondered if she would ever have\\r\\nanother opportunity. “If I have the courage to advertise again,” she\\r\\nadded, for even that seemed doubtful to her at that hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Damn the fellow,” she said at last. “He has disturbed my life to no\\r\\npurpose, he has raised a hundred questions he cannot answer; I should\\r\\nhave been happier if I had never seen him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it seemed to her that every fresh experience in life would always\\r\\nbring her such regrets; that all struggles were only destined to make\\r\\nher suffer, and that the best course perhaps was to go through life\\r\\nblindly, living from day to day, immersed in a world of dreams like her\\r\\nfather, and like him shunning all contact with her fellow creatures.\\r\\nThese thoughts were dreadful to her, for the afternoons she had passed\\r\\nsitting at the Burnt Farm talking to Richard Sotheby while he painted\\r\\nher were precious. “The happiest moments in my life,” she cried. “For I\\r\\nthought then that I had found a friend.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYet it was true: she would have been happier if she had never met him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am not jealous,” she exclaimed. “I know he is in love with Ginette\\r\\nGrandison; I have always known it, and it has never given me a\\r\\nmoment’s pang of jealousy. If only he had spoken of her, if he had told\\r\\nme he was going back to her, I should have felt happy for his sake. I\\r\\nshould not have had a single selfish thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he has made me lay bare my whole life to him and has never once\\r\\nspoken of his own. I only know of the existence of Ginette Grandison by\\r\\nan accident; he would not trust me with his secret and would be annoyed\\r\\nat my knowing it. No friendship can be based on anything so one-sided\\r\\nas our conversations have been. And the reason is plain, only that I\\r\\nhave been too stupid to see it before. The reason is that he never\\r\\nintended a friendship. It amused him to get my little secret from me;\\r\\nit flattered his....”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Anne suddenly checked her thought, crying: “No, that is vulgar,\\r\\nthat is unworthy. The root of the matter is that I mean nothing to\\r\\nhim, nothing, whilst to me he is the only man with whom I have spoken\\r\\nfreely; the only intimate friend except Enid that I have ever had. And\\r\\nhe cares no more for me than she did.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA flood of tears eased her heart; she turned her face to the pillow;\\r\\nthen, when she had done weeping, she got out of bed once more and went\\r\\nto the window. The air was cold; there was a gust of wind in the\\r\\nchimney; the weather-cock gave its gentle whine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter standing there an hour, Anne went back to bed again with a\\r\\npicture of the darkness in her mind, saying to herself: “And so on for\\r\\never and ever, cold and darkness after the sunshine and the warmth of\\r\\nthe day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning Anne felt ill when she woke; her head ached, she was\\r\\ndizzy, and the outer world was seen alternately as a whirling mist and\\r\\ndefined with extraordinary clearness. She got up from habit, but she\\r\\ncould eat nothing at breakfast, and as soon as her bed had been made\\r\\nshe undressed and lay down on it, and fell asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she awoke it was with the echo of Richard’s voice ringing in her\\r\\nears; she scrambled out of bed and went at once to her window. There\\r\\nwas nothing to be seen, she blinked her eyes in the brilliant sunlight\\r\\nand, reeling with sleep, groped her way back through the sudden\\r\\ndarkness of the room to her bed to fall into a doze from which she\\r\\nawoke once more, this time with the certainty of having heard voices:\\r\\nbeyond a doubt, one of them was Richard’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voices rose for a moment; then she heard the front door slam, in a\\r\\ngust of wind, and there was a silence. She understood suddenly that\\r\\nRichard had been in the house, that he had come to see her, and she got\\r\\nout of bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bedroom window gave on to the garden, so she ran to her father’s\\r\\nroom just as she had done to see the ploughmen on that snowy winter\\r\\nmorning. Her guess had been right, for there almost directly beneath\\r\\nher were Richard and her father; they were standing bare-headed in the\\r\\nrain talking amicably; she could hear her father’s gentle laugh; they\\r\\nwere reluctant to part. Anne’s first instinct was to call out; to ask\\r\\nRichard to wait while she exchanged her dressing-gown for clothes in\\r\\nwhich she could appear, but she realized that it was impossible to\\r\\ndo so, and then, with the angry feelings that every sick person has\\r\\nexperienced of knowing that life is going on unchanged behind his back,\\r\\nshe was forced to watch Richard disappear after shaking hands with her\\r\\nfather by the garden gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A thousand pities,” she said to herself. “He must have come to see me.\\r\\nWhat can he have said to my father?” Her headache and dizziness were\\r\\ngone, she felt eager and excited, and the moments while she was putting\\r\\non her clothes and doing up her hair were spent in trying to imagine\\r\\nthe conversation that had been going on while she was asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What an extraordinary thing,” said Anne, “that he should think of\\r\\ncalling! Nobody but Richard would have done such a thing!” Her thoughts\\r\\nwere interrupted by Maggie coming to ask her if she would like to have\\r\\ntea in bed. As she was going downstairs it occurred to her that Richard\\r\\nmight have spoken of her; he would have told her father that they had\\r\\nmet; he might even have mentioned his picture. As she opened the door\\r\\ninto the room where her father was already sitting, she remembered\\r\\nthe well-brought-up heroes in Victorian novels who ask a father’s\\r\\npermission before entering into correspondence with the girl they have\\r\\nrescued when the pony has taken the bit between its teeth and the\\r\\ngoverness cart is heading for the side of the quarry ... a memory which\\r\\nwas driven away with a laugh, but which left her anxious and expectant\\r\\nas she took her place at the tea table.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dunnock did not make any reference to his visitor, though he\\r\\nwas less abstracted than usual, asking Anne with great solicitude\\r\\nabout her headache, and then saying: “I have been feeling a little\\r\\nmore melancholy than usual to-day because of the bad weather, and\\r\\nso I took down Burton. In his anatomy he has much to say about the\\r\\neffect of food. The authorities all agree that beef is only safe for\\r\\nthose who lead an active life; that pork is definitely bad for the\\r\\nreasoning man; that goats’ flesh disposes those who partake of it to\\r\\nevil-living; venison is most strongly condemned, and even horse-flesh\\r\\nis held to account for the well-known melancholy of your Spaniard;\\r\\namong vegetables the onion and its congeners, and I am glad to say the\\r\\ncabbage, are absolutely condemned; peas and beans should be avoided\\r\\nas far as possible, and salads and fruit only taken in the strictest\\r\\nmoderation. Burton thinks that the potato may be a safe article of\\r\\ndiet, and highly recommends borage.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was smiling at her father’s enthusiasm. “There seems very little\\r\\nfor you to eat,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Anne, I do not know quite what Burton would recommend; he says\\r\\nnothing against wheaten bread; he regards fresh country cheese as\\r\\nwholesome, and speaks with enthusiasm of beer.” Mr. Dunnock giggled as\\r\\nhe said this and for some reason that familiar clerical sound seemed\\r\\nto his daughter at that moment to express all that she most hated and\\r\\ndespised. “The giggle is unforgivable,” she said to herself gazing\\r\\nat her father over the tea table. “He is a grown-up man; he has a\\r\\nbeard; he is my father, but if beer is mentioned one hears a silly\\r\\nadolescent giggle. One would think that he was a choir boy caught with\\r\\na cigarette.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left the table and went out into the garden in a fury; she had\\r\\nforgotten her own embarrassment when Richard had used the word “rape.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dunnock, absorbed in his own thoughts, hardly looked after her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beer,” he said, pouring himself out a fourth cup of tea, and giggling\\r\\nslightly. “Good stuff, beer. He thought that because his name was\\r\\nBurton,” and Mr. Dunnock began to wonder if Robert Burton had really\\r\\ncome from Burton-on-Trent, and if beer had always been brewed there.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I forgot to tell you,” he said to Anne at supper, “that I had a visit\\r\\nthis afternoon from Richard Sotheby, the son of our grocer. It was a\\r\\ngreat pity that you had a headache, for we do not have many interesting\\r\\nvisitors. I think he is charming: a most delightful, most intelligent\\r\\nyoung man. But you should have told me that you had met him; you should\\r\\nhave asked him to tea, and have introduced him to me. It was too bad,\\r\\nAnne, to have kept him to yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne gasped with astonishment and, not knowing what to reply, waited\\r\\nuntil her father went on: “He seems to have liked you very much; you\\r\\nhave made quite a conquest,” and Mr. Dunnock smiled his peculiar little\\r\\nsmile which showed that he was not speaking seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought you rather disapproved of the Sothebys,” said Anne.\\r\\n“Because, of course, they are Nonconformists.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well,” said her father, wrinkling up his face at the word, for\\r\\nit set his teeth on edge like the thought of sour fruit. “Well, well, I\\r\\nsuppose they are happy with their little ugly worship; I confess their\\r\\noutlook is repugnant to me. But the son has escaped from all that. He\\r\\ntold me he has been to visit Little Gidding, and asked me a number of\\r\\nquestions about Nicholas Ferrar’s community. Apparently he is greatly\\r\\ninterested in the antiquities of the county.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had known Little Gidding all her life, and she shared her father’s\\r\\nlove for the lonely little church perched on the edge of the hillside,\\r\\nwith the slope of green sward below and the woods behind. She had been\\r\\nbrought up to revere Nicholas Ferrar, and had loved to reconstruct a\\r\\nlife which had so much of the beauty of religion in it, and nothing\\r\\nof what she disliked. Often she thought that she would have been\\r\\ncontent for her father to have been a clergyman if he had lived in the\\r\\nseventeenth century, or even in the eighteenth for the matter of that,\\r\\nfor it was only during the reign of Queen Victoria that the clergy in\\r\\nEngland lost touch with the community and became self-conscious. Anne\\r\\nknew how much happier her father would have been had he belonged to\\r\\nNicholas Ferrar’s household, and though she would not have cared for\\r\\nit herself (she would have disliked rising at four o’clock for prayers\\r\\nevery morning) she wished he could live in such a way himself. Thus for\\r\\nonce she was tolerant, for she loved Little Gidding, and had prayed in\\r\\nthe narrow little church with an outburst of religious passion such as\\r\\nshe had never experienced in Ely Cathedral.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the rest of that evening father and daughter spoke of Little\\r\\nGidding, calling up pictures in each other’s minds of how it must be\\r\\nlooking in the spring weather, and of the life of the immense and\\r\\nextraordinary household which had lived there until the Roundheads had\\r\\nburned the roof over their heads and had thrown the brass eagle lectern\\r\\nin the church into the pond below.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The men slept in one wing of the house and the women in the other,”\\r\\nAnne remembered. “And Nicholas Ferrar slept watchfully in the middle.\\r\\nThat is the funny side,” but she hid her thought from her father, and\\r\\nwhen she spoke it was to remind him of the immense number of children\\r\\nin the community.\\r\\n\\r\\n“His daughter brought her eleven children; there were thirty people\\r\\naltogether,” said her father, and he passed on to describe the three\\r\\nvisits of King Charles I, and so vivid were his words that Anne could\\r\\npicture to herself, more clearly than ever before, the visit the King\\r\\npaid during the civil war when he came toiling up the hill on foot, and\\r\\nalone, to pray.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is no more sacred spot in England,” said Mr. Dunnock, and Anne\\r\\nwas inclined to agree with him. That night she lay for some time\\r\\nwithout sleeping, giving herself up to the happiest thoughts, and\\r\\nwhen at last she dozed off it was with the picture of Richard Sotheby\\r\\nin her mind: Richard walking over the greenest turf where the manor\\r\\nhouse had stood, resting on the sides of the dry grassy moat, and then\\r\\nwalking down by the edge of the wood to the little church with Nicholas\\r\\nFerrar’s tomb in the pathway leading up to it, under a tombstone, the\\r\\nletters of which are written in moss. A tall figure came toiling up the\\r\\nhill to meet him; she saw a tired man with a pale face--King Charles\\r\\nthe First, and try how she would to dream of Richard Sotheby, King\\r\\nCharles would reappear.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall certainly try to see Richard before he goes this morning,”\\r\\nAnne thought at breakfast. “I shall look in and tell Mrs. Sotheby that\\r\\nI have come to say good-bye.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the time came she went past the shop, for she remembered Mr.\\r\\nSotheby’s look of surprise when he found that she was acquainted with\\r\\nhis son, and the long hostile silence before he spoke, after he had\\r\\nrecognized her in the painting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Sotheby does not approve of my knowing Richard,” Anne said to\\r\\nherself, glancing through the windows of the shop. She could see no\\r\\none inside, and the longer she meditated over the grocer’s behaviour\\r\\nat Rachel’s birthday party, the more convinced she became that he was\\r\\njealous of her, and alarmed lest an attachment should spring up between\\r\\nhis son and her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will go for a stroll on the green,” and looking about her she saw\\r\\nfor the first time that the sun was shining, and that the grass was\\r\\ngreener after the rain of the day before. “Why, the hawthorns have come\\r\\ninto leaf; the horse-chestnut buds are bursting; in a few days the\\r\\napples will be in blossom,” but the daily progress of the spring, which\\r\\nwould ordinarily have given her such keen pleasure, was meaningless\\r\\nnow. “I must see Richard before he goes,” she said in desperation.\\r\\n“I must arrange with him about finding me work in Paris,” and she\\r\\nremembered with dismay that she did not even know his address.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon she turned back on her footsteps, and fully an hour was spent in\\r\\npassing and repassing the grocer’s shop.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am wasting my time,” she thought. “For Easter is nearly upon us;\\r\\nthere is much to do at the church.” But it was not possible to go\\r\\nhome after waiting so long, and at last she set off along the road to\\r\\nLinton. A mile was covered before it occurred to her that Richard would\\r\\nbe driving with his father, and that even if Mr. Sotheby should pull up\\r\\nit would be difficult for them to speak in front of him, and she turned\\r\\nback and walked to the village at top speed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll seemed well, for she had not passed them on the road, and she\\r\\ndetermined once more to enter the shop, but it occurred to her, as she\\r\\napproached, that Rachel would be coming out of school in a few minutes:\\r\\nit was just twelve o’clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she turned the corner by the schoolhouse, she noticed the strange\\r\\nring deeply cut into the earth and full of dust, and wondered again\\r\\nwhat game the children played there.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the door opened and the children began to run out. “In this riot I\\r\\nshall not be able to speak to Rachel,” Anne said to herself. “But if I\\r\\nwalk back towards the shop she may walk another way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A lovely morning, Miss Dunnock,” said a voice behind her, and she\\r\\nturned to find Mr. Lambert.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moments spent talking to him were agonizing, for every instant\\r\\nshe expected to see Rachel run past her, but Mr. Lambert would not be\\r\\nhurried. Soon he began to speak of Easter, and the arrangements at the\\r\\nchurch, for he was a churchwarden, and when that subject was exhausted\\r\\nhe returned to the weather.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One is happy to be alive on such a morning, Miss Dunnock; I envy you\\r\\nyour leisure to enjoy it. Free as air, Miss Dunnock, and no one to call\\r\\nyour master. Work is my master. This weather keeps us very busy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Impertinent puppy,” said Anne to herself, though as a matter of fact\\r\\nshe rather liked Mr. Lambert, and saw nothing impertinent in his\\r\\nmanners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the very moment when Mr. Lambert released her she heard Rachel’s\\r\\nvoice saying: “Good morning, Miss Dunnock,” and the little girl ran by\\r\\nher with two or three other children. Anne saw that it was useless to\\r\\nwait any longer, and returned to the vicarage; there was nothing to be\\r\\nangry about, nobody was at fault.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was this note left for you. Rachel Sotheby brought it over,”\\r\\nsaid Maggie when she went into the kitchen, and Anne thought the\\r\\ngirl’s grin was an impertinence too.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard had gone by the early morning train. “I am so sorry not to see\\r\\nyou to say good-bye,” he wrote. “You must not forget your promise to\\r\\nwrite, and remember to tell me all the news of the parish.” He enclosed\\r\\nhis address.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nELEVEN: BEFORE THE SWALLOW DARES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEaster was over, but the church at Dry Coulter was still full of the\\r\\nscent of flowers mingled with the odour of their corruption. A necklace\\r\\nof decayed marsh-mallows hung forlornly round the neck of the eagle;\\r\\nits brazen beak held a bunch of wilted cowslips, but the daffodils and\\r\\nnarcissus on the altar still breathed out their perfume. Easter was\\r\\nover, and Mr. Dunnock heaved a sigh of relief for he had come to feel\\r\\nthe church festivals a great strain upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nEaster was over; Mrs. Pattle marched up the aisle on her flat feet and\\r\\nbegan tearing down the flowers which her children had gathered three\\r\\ndays before.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dunnock walked by the little pathway from the vestry to his wife’s\\r\\ngrave, and stood there looking at the headstone. He stayed there so\\r\\nlong and stood so still that a robin, recognizing a friend in him, came\\r\\nto perch on his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The resurrection of the flesh has come to pass,” Mr. Dunnock said\\r\\naloud. “These ones come to me and they commune with me; why does she\\r\\nalone delay?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last a cow lowing on the other side of the hedge, interrupted the\\r\\nclergyman’s reverie; he started slightly and coming to himself began\\r\\nto pull his beard with a gesture of despair, and the robin, who had\\r\\nbeen wondering if he could induce his wife to nest in it, flew off to a\\r\\ntombstone, disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I live in two worlds,” Mr. Dunnock reflected. “Only the saints know\\r\\nhow terrible the strain of such an experience can be. I cannot bear\\r\\nit much longer; something will break in me. My head aches when I am\\r\\nrecalled from the contemplation of so much glory to the pettiness in\\r\\nwhich men live, their eyes on the ground and their ears stopped to\\r\\nthe voices of the angels. I cannot endure it any longer; it would be\\r\\nbetter, I think, if I were to live alone.” He clutched at his head\\r\\nsuddenly, and then walked rapidly from the churchyard towards the\\r\\nvicarage. But the song of a willow wren caught his ear as he passed\\r\\nunder the elms, and he paused to listen. The clear top note was\\r\\nfollowed by a stream of softer sounds and ended with a cadence of lower\\r\\nnotes, a touch of melancholy in which the vicar felt his own heart\\r\\nexpressed. The bird sang, and sang again, and Mr. Dunnock, resting his\\r\\nshoulder against the rough bark of an elm, listened without seeing the\\r\\napproach of two village women, or noticing their inquisitive glances\\r\\nas they passed near him, or hearing their words, for, in answer to a\\r\\nnudge, one of them had protested to her companion: “Oh, dear me, Fanny.\\r\\nDon’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were silent for fear of laughing, but when they had passed the\\r\\nvicar, one of them said: “Maggie told me she couldn’t make anything of\\r\\nhis sermon on Easter Sunday. It was all about Easter Eggs being the\\r\\npromise of glory. She didn’t know what he meant by it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the women did not laugh, and soon turned to safer and more\\r\\ninteresting topics of conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe willow wren had been silent a long while, and was looking for\\r\\nworms, when at last for Mr. Dunnock also the mood of ecstasy passed;\\r\\nhe looked about him startled and bewildered, and then, reassured by\\r\\nfinding he was alone, he shook his head sadly, and the first glance of\\r\\nfear was replaced by a bitter smile as he hurried back to the vicarage\\r\\nat top speed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lay my meals on a tray in future,” he said to Maggie a few minutes\\r\\nlater. “And put the tray on the table in the passage outside my study.\\r\\nI shall hear if you tap on the door.” Words which were repeated to\\r\\nAnne when she came down to lunch. She was content to be alone, but at\\r\\ndinner she was disturbed at this alteration in her father’s habits,\\r\\nwondering whether he were unwell, or whether by any chance Maggie were\\r\\nright in believing that he wished the change to be permanent. But this\\r\\nseemed to her so unlikely a possibility that she did not dwell on it,\\r\\nand, when the meal was over, she lit the lamp and settled down with\\r\\nher drawing-board in front of her; she had at last begun the fashion\\r\\nplates which she had been projecting all the winter. The fine weather\\r\\nhad returned after Richard Sotheby’s departure, and for the first day\\r\\nof warm sunshine Anne had found happiness enough in being out of doors,\\r\\na happiness shot through with irritation against herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am wasting my life looking at this pear blossom. What does it\\r\\nmatter to me whether the fruit set or not? I shall be gone before the\\r\\ngathering.” But her habitual interest had been too strong for her, and\\r\\nshe had watched the bees flying in and out among the masses of curdy\\r\\npetals with delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am lingering on. I shall linger all my life. I must go now; I must\\r\\nleave home to-day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was impossible to leave on the day before Easter, and instead\\r\\nof packing her box, she had gone to the church to pin up the notice\\r\\nsaying: “There will be no service on Saturday, when the church will be\\r\\nopen for decoration.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Saturday had come she had gone herself to help the little girls,\\r\\nand it was not until after Easter was over that the fashion plates had\\r\\nbeen begun. The results of her labours surpassed Anne’s expectations;\\r\\nsuch fashion plates as hers she felt sure would excite the Parisian\\r\\ndressmakers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must send them to Richard at once,” she said as she took out the\\r\\ndrawing-pins. But the thought of waiting for a letter, and the agony\\r\\nof uncertainty in which she saw herself, dismayed her. In her mood of\\r\\nexultation delay of any kind seemed impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I will wait all the same,” she said, “until I have finished a\\r\\ndozen, and then I shall go to Paris myself to seek my fortune. I will\\r\\nwrite and tell Richard that I am coming.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter was put off; she would not write until she knew the day and\\r\\nthe hour of her arrival, and for several days she worked hard, shutting\\r\\nherself up in her room every morning when the bed had been made. When\\r\\nshe laid down her brush it was to plan how she would have her hair cut\\r\\noff in London, and how she would buy herself a smart dress for the\\r\\njourney, for she believed that she would never impress a dressmaker in\\r\\nsuch rags as she possessed. With her mind full of such matters, Anne\\r\\nrose and looked out of her window; the first blush of pink petals was\\r\\nshowing through the early green of the apple trees; in another week\\r\\nthey would be in full blossom. Under the trees Mr. Dunnock was standing\\r\\nwith his arms raised above his head, gazing up at the sky, a pose which\\r\\nAnne found sufficiently startling to make her look again, carefully\\r\\nscreening her eyes from the sunlight. Her father stood motionless;\\r\\nevery little while she could see a small bird fly up and settle on his\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have scarcely spoken to father for three days; I must speak to him\\r\\nnow and tell him of my plans,” and as she made this resolution, she\\r\\nsaw him moving slowly across the lawn. As he came nearer she saw that\\r\\na crowd of little birds was following him, a wild twittering came from\\r\\nthem, they were mobbing him as though he were a cat or an owl; at every\\r\\nmoment birds would settle on his head or shoulders, or on his up-raised\\r\\nhands, and then would fly off again.\\r\\n\\r\\nA beautiful spectacle it seemed to Anne, and she felt a new tenderness\\r\\nfor her father as she watched. The thin black figure with the head\\r\\nthrown back, the eyes turned up, and the beard jutting out, no longer\\r\\nseemed queer as it had a moment before, when she had first caught\\r\\nsight of it standing under the apple trees.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He will feel my desertion,” she murmured, a sudden sympathy with her\\r\\nfather coming to her, and she felt a love which had been forgotten for\\r\\nmany months.\\r\\n\\r\\n“First mother, and then me,” she said. But her love did not weaken her\\r\\ndetermination to speak to him of her departure, but strengthened it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Dunnock reached the house, he shook his head, first gently,\\r\\nbut then, as a blue-tit still remained perched there, more violently,\\r\\nand then turning round waved his hands towards the birds which had\\r\\nsettled in the rose bushes about the door. Anne saw that he was\\r\\nbestowing a benediction. She did not wait longer, but hurrying\\r\\ndownstairs, followed her father into his study.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We see very little of each other now, father,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dunnock started at her words and looked round at her with guilty\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Anne, yes,” he murmured. “Do you wish to speak to me? Something\\r\\nperhaps about the housekeeping?” and he began to fidget with his\\r\\nfingers, wishing that she would go away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have wanted to speak to you for some time,” said Anne. “I have been\\r\\nthinking a great deal about my own life. It will seem very selfish to\\r\\nyou, and very heartless. It is very selfish....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are all of us selfish,” said Mr. Dunnock. “What is it that you\\r\\nwant?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to go away, at least for a time,” said Anne. “I do not want to\\r\\nsettle down for the rest of my life without seeing something of the\\r\\nworld. I have never been to London.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a silence, and after a little she went on: “I shall have to\\r\\nearn my own living, of course, but that should not be impossible. An\\r\\nexperiment ... an experience ... the experience would be good for me. I\\r\\nhave never been to London. There are so many things.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That seems a very sensible plan, if it can be managed,” said Mr.\\r\\nDunnock, cutting her short. “But then you have plenty of good sense,\\r\\nAnne, more than I have in some ways.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat down suddenly at his writing table, dropping his head between\\r\\nhis hands, and there he remained, silent for so long that Anne began to\\r\\nwonder if he had forgotten her, but she said nothing, only repeating\\r\\nunder her breath: “It is settled: I am leaving home.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at last Mr. Dunnock looked up, saying: “Let me see.... What was\\r\\nI going to say? You will require some money, Anne, if you are going\\r\\naway. I can give you twenty pounds, enough to enable you to look about\\r\\nyou. Do as you think best, dear child, in every way.” His head began to\\r\\nnod again, and then, as if suddenly waking up, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am glad you are going, Anne. I am glad the suggestion came from you:\\r\\nthat it should be your own wish. I am rather bad company, I know, but\\r\\nthere is a reason for that. You think my life here is narrow perhaps,\\r\\nbut you see only one side. I can assure you that you are mistaken; my\\r\\nlife is incredibly rich and overflowing with happiness. But that has to\\r\\nbe hidden; there is a reason for that. I need loneliness; you perhaps\\r\\nneed to see the world at present, but we shall meet again, and I have\\r\\nno fear that ultimately ... you will understand what is hidden....” He\\r\\nbroke off disconnectedly, and suddenly Anne felt her happiness shot\\r\\nthrough by a feeling of dismay, in which she wondered if she could\\r\\nleave her father to fend for himself. Such phrases were familiar to her\\r\\nfrom his lips, but they seemed strange coming at such a moment and when\\r\\nshe went from the room it was with a conviction that she would be doing\\r\\nwrong to go away.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer scruples were soon forgotten in the excitement of making plans, and\\r\\nthe rest of the day was spent in packing and unpacking a wooden box\\r\\nwith her possessions. Two days later all was ready, and the hour of her\\r\\ndeparture had been fixed for the morrow. In the morning she went to say\\r\\ngood-bye to Mrs. Sotheby, and to ask if Rachel would come to have tea\\r\\nwith her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We shall miss you very much,” said Mrs. Sotheby. “But I shall try to\\r\\nthink that you are enjoying yourself seeing more of the world than you\\r\\nwould here. I hardly know what to say about Rachel. You know how fond\\r\\nshe is of you. She will want to come to say good-bye; it is a great\\r\\npity that Mr. Sotheby has arranged to take us to see the cottages at\\r\\nLinton. You would not care to come with us, I suppose? Then everyone\\r\\nwould be happy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should like to come very much,” said Anne, “if I shall not be in the\\r\\nway.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll just ask Mr. Sotheby if there will be room in the dog-cart for us\\r\\nall,” said the old woman and, through the opened door into the parlour,\\r\\nAnne could see the grocer sitting at the table, looking up from a sheet\\r\\nof blue paper with a T-square in his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey set off soon after lunch, Anne sitting on the back seat of the\\r\\ndog-cart with Rachel, but the pony did not seem to feel the extra\\r\\nweight. Anne soon set Rachel talking, and the little girl kept her\\r\\namused with stories of her school, and how she had been teased about\\r\\nher brother, and it was some time before she broke the news of her\\r\\nown departure. Rachel stared down at the road, a yellow river flowing\\r\\nso swiftly from below the dog-cart that she could not distinguish the\\r\\nstones in it. “You won’t ever think of me; you won’t write to me; you\\r\\nwon’t ever come back,” were her thoughts, but she knew that she must\\r\\nhide her unhappiness, and when she spoke, as the trap drew up smartly,\\r\\nit was to ask: “Will you be going to Paris?” a question which Anne\\r\\nfound so disturbing that she saw little of the first cottage into which\\r\\nshe was led. The smell of fresh paint, mingled with the fragrance\\r\\nof aromatic pine shavings on the plank floors, recalled her to her\\r\\nsurroundings, and she listened for a moment to Mr. Sotheby, who was\\r\\nspeaking to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“These cottages are only a stepping-stone to greater things, Miss\\r\\nDunnock. I have mortgaged them already. What Linton lacks is a\\r\\nhigh-class Temperance Hotel, overlooking the river. Such a hotel would\\r\\nattract visitors for the fishing and boating, and would cater also\\r\\nfor the more respectable commercial men. A Temperance Hotel would\\r\\nwake up trade in the town, and would provide a delightful centre for\\r\\nholiday-makers and abstainers, and men from the university.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What shall I say to Rachel?” Anne asked herself as she followed the\\r\\ngrocer up the little staircase into the poky bedrooms, which smelt of\\r\\nvarnish.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A little shop like ours is a great snare for a man with ambition. I\\r\\nhave wasted the best years of my life in it, years during which I might\\r\\nhave built up a great merchandising house. But this hotel, and others\\r\\nlike it, will soon make my son a rich man, and provide for Rachel. A\\r\\nTemperance Hotel with a grand loggia looking over the river, pillars\\r\\nwith climbing roses, a small winter garden with azaleas.... We must\\r\\nmove with the times, you know, Miss Dunnock.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne descended the narrow stairs and followed Mrs. Sotheby across a\\r\\npatch of sticky clay to the dog-cart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I am going to Paris. Don’t tell anyone; it is a secret,” she said\\r\\nto the little girl as they drove off. It was only after saying this\\r\\nthat Anne looked up at the cottages, seeing them for the first time.\\r\\nTheir extreme ugliness and the evident signs of jerry-building dismayed\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What will the next thing be like?” she asked herself, remembering\\r\\nthe grocer had spoken of an hotel, and expecting to see it round the\\r\\ncorner. In a moment or two Mr. Sotheby drew rein by the side of the\\r\\nquiet stream of the Ouse, but there was no building visible, only an\\r\\nempty field, the site for the new hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A lounge hall lit entirely by windows of yellow stained glass is my\\r\\nidea,” said Mr. Sotheby. “It will give the effect of sunshine all\\r\\nthe year round. The landing-stage is to run the entire length of the\\r\\nbuilding. It will be covered by a glass roof. There is to be a garage\\r\\non the right and a boathouse on the left, each under its own dome\\r\\nof glass, thus giving symmetry to the whole. There will be central\\r\\nheating, a lift, electric light, a banqueting hall....”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne gazed at the water-logged field, at the slow stream with the\\r\\nbunches of reeds and the gasworks on the opposite bank, and ceased to\\r\\nlisten to Mr. Sotheby’s words. The mud and water and slime would remain\\r\\nmud and water and slime; the fine old bridge with the toll house,\\r\\nwhich had once been a chapel, would stay there; nothing would move the\\r\\ngasworks, and Anne felt unable to picture to herself the glittering\\r\\nabomination of which the grocer spoke, on that melancholy river bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr. Sotheby went on talking for some time, and, turning her head,\\r\\nAnne could see that his wife was not listening, and her own attention\\r\\nsoon wandered. She saw the whip being pointed first in one direction\\r\\nand then in another, and the white beard which wagged as the grocer\\r\\nopened and shut his mouth, but the stream of words went on unheard. At\\r\\nlast Mr. Sotheby picked up the reins, cracked his whip, and they set\\r\\noff for home. Except for Rachel, they had enjoyed themselves as Mrs.\\r\\nSotheby had predicted.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one in Dry Coulter would have recognized the slim figure in a\\r\\nfashionable tailor-made dress who took her seat in the boat-train three\\r\\ndays later. When she shook her head to refuse the offer of magazines,\\r\\nno hairpins flew on to the platform, and the reason was explained when\\r\\nshe removed her rakish little hat: Anne wore an Eton crop. Her whole\\r\\ncharacter seemed to her to have changed, and looking into the mirror\\r\\nin the lid of her little vanity-case, she was pleased with her new\\r\\nself. For a moment she fingered an unused lip-stick and then, laughing\\r\\nto herself, deliberately reddened her lips. She was off to Paris,\\r\\nalone, to seek her fortune. Her father, everyone at Dry Coulter, every\\r\\nexperience she had ever had in her life seemed never to have existed.\\r\\nIt was a dream which would be speedily forgotten, and reaching for her\\r\\nbag, Anne opened a French book of which Richard had spoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhere in the Weald of Kent, the grinding noise of the brakes,\\r\\nsuddenly applied, disturbed her reading. The train dragged itself to a\\r\\nhalt and a long silence followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last Anne threw open the window and peered into the darkness.\\r\\nThere was nothing to be seen but a red light shining somewhere down\\r\\nthe line, and the vague forms of oak trees near at hand. For a moment\\r\\nthere was nothing to be heard, and then, suddenly, her ear caught a\\r\\nfar-off melodious chuckle and a moment afterwards the first startling\\r\\nclear notes of a bird’s song. The red light changed to green; there was\\r\\na long puff, and a series of snorts from the engine; the ticking of\\r\\nreleased brakes, and once more the train was in motion. But Anne had\\r\\nrecognized the note of the nightingale.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Love,” she said to herself, and began laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTWELVE: RICHARD’S FRIENDS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo men and a woman were having breakfast in the studio in their\\r\\ndressing-gowns.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, my God, Grandison!” exclaimed Richard Sotheby, after looking into\\r\\nthe letter which Anne had posted two days before in London. “What am I\\r\\nto do? Here is that girl arriving in Paris to-morrow. She asks me to\\r\\nget her lodgings, and to meet her at the station. What on earth am I to\\r\\ndo? I wonder if I could stop her coming.... She doesn’t give her London\\r\\naddress. No, I can’t stop her. Oh, what a curse....”\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison laughed and, turning to the woman beside her, told her the\\r\\nnews in bad French. A look of incredulity passed over her brown face,\\r\\nand then she also began to laugh. The dark eyes sparkled with malice,\\r\\nthe even white teeth shone, she put the point of her healthy pink\\r\\ntongue between her painted lips; and then, the humour of the situation\\r\\nincreasing as she turned the news over in her mind, she sprang up and\\r\\ndanced bare-footed round the breakfast table in the middle of the\\r\\nimmense room. The skirts of the silk dressing-gown whirled round the\\r\\nlithe body; every movement was lovely, but neither of the men looked\\r\\nat her. When she stopped it was to pour out a flood of questions which\\r\\nwent unanswered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is not a joke,” said Richard Sotheby gloomily. “You will have to\\r\\nhelp me. You don’t object, I suppose,” he added in French to the girl,\\r\\n“if Grandison devotes his time to her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How insolent you are, Richard!” said the woman, taking hold of\\r\\nGrandison’s arm, and putting her cheek beside his head. “I am to be\\r\\nsacrificed because you can’t face a woman. I could call you some hard\\r\\nnames if I chose.” She pouted, but at once went on: “But I won’t, for\\r\\nI sympathize with you. Really I am anxious to see this girl of yours,\\r\\nRichard. It will be a curiosity. Are you going to bring her to live\\r\\nwith us? I shall be charming to her, and she will keep me company\\r\\nsometimes. Two men is more than I can manage.” She pouted again, and\\r\\nadded in tones of deep tenderness: “Two dirty Englishmen.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Sotheby looked at her with a patient smile, then, ignoring her\\r\\nquestions, he turned to his friend and said, speaking in English: “And\\r\\ntwo women is more than I can manage.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison flushed with anger, but Richard forestalled anything he might\\r\\nhave said by adding: “My dear, you know I am fond of Ginette; don’t\\r\\nmisunderstand what I say. But two women is more than I can put up\\r\\nwith....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why on earth will you persist in regarding Ginette as a woman?”\\r\\ndemanded the younger man in tones of fury. “Woman! woman! It’s always\\r\\nwoman with you. Ginette is Ginette, just as I am Gerald and you are\\r\\nRichard.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSotheby did not reply, and his friend’s angry tones soon subsided.\\r\\nHarmony was restored while the breakfast dishes were cleared away,\\r\\nand for the rest of the morning Anne’s arrival was discussed calmly,\\r\\nsometimes in English, sometimes in French, while the two men painted\\r\\nand Ginette posed. In the evening everything that had been said in the\\r\\nmorning was repeated, but at last it was decided that Grandison should\\r\\nmeet Anne at the station, instead of Richard, and that he should take\\r\\nher to an hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let it be on the other side of Paris,” said Richard next morning, as\\r\\nhe and Grandison left the studio on their way to the station, for he\\r\\nhad decided to accompany his friend in order to point out the girl whom\\r\\nhe was to meet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everything in France is different,” Anne said to herself as she\\r\\nlooked out of the window of the train. “Those trees must be elms, but\\r\\nthey have been shaved like French poodles so that they are scarcely\\r\\nrecognizable. These are fields of corn, and here are cocks and hens\\r\\nand cart-sheds, but they do not seem to be the real things so much as\\r\\nimitations of ours. And the houses! How extraordinarily different are\\r\\nthe houses!” for the train was passing through a station, and building\\r\\nafter building flashed by her: dreary houses with the stucco peeling\\r\\noff them, each with its broken-slatted shutters beside the windows,\\r\\nhouses such as do not exist in England.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If there is any beauty in this country it is of another kind from\\r\\nour English beauty, just as the ugliness is unlike our ugliness.” The\\r\\nchange did not dismay her; it had the same effect of strangeness as the\\r\\nreflection of her own cropped head in the glass, seen unexpectedly as\\r\\nshe lifted her handbag from off the luggage rack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train was approaching Paris, and before many minutes had passed a\\r\\nporter in a blue blouse had seized upon her handbag and Anne forgot to\\r\\nlook for Richard Sotheby in the effort to produce a good impression\\r\\non the porter. But even the inadequacy of her French could not detain\\r\\nhim for more than a moment. His moustache trembled eagerly, his eye\\r\\nflashed, then he had disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a lovely outline there is to his cheek, how clear his\\r\\ncomplexion, how expressive his every movement!” and looking after the\\r\\nporter she began to fancy that if all Frenchmen were as handsome as the\\r\\nporter she would be in love with them all. “The beauty of the French\\r\\nface,” she said, “lies in the beauty of the cheekbones. An English face\\r\\nis made up of eyes and nose and mouth: the rest of the face is a blank\\r\\nspace, but take away a Frenchman’s eyes: so often like eggs, or olives,\\r\\ntake away his nose, and his mouth (always an uninteresting mouth) and\\r\\nyou find his face is still full of expression and of beauty, indeed the\\r\\nface is improved.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the porter was back, and had set off down the platform with a\\r\\ncommanding gesture to Anne to follow him, when she found herself being\\r\\naccosted by a stranger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is this Miss Dunnock? My name’s Grandison,” he said. “Richard Sotheby\\r\\nasked me to meet you here; he is not able to come himself....”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ginette Grandison’s brother,” Anne said to herself, looking into the\\r\\nsurly, boyish face, and noticing Grandison’s shyness. Meanwhile the\\r\\nporter with the lovely cheekbones had disappeared with her suit-case.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What does the porter matter?” she thought. “What does the suit-case\\r\\nmatter? What does it matter what this young man is mumbling about\\r\\nRichard? No, nothing matters. This is Paris; I have arrived, and a\\r\\ndelightful happy life awaits me with these charming people. The opera\\r\\n... friends.” In such a mood it seemed scarcely surprising that Richard\\r\\nshould after all come up to them just as they were climbing into a cab.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is the latest news from Dry Coulter?” he asked, taking the seat\\r\\nbeside her. Anne had not slept; the channel crossing by night was too\\r\\nexciting an experience to be missed, and she had remained on deck,\\r\\nwatching the receding lights of England disappear, and then the lights\\r\\nof France springing up out of the darkness and growing in brilliance\\r\\nand in number.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dry Coulter?” she asked, and for the first moment the name conveyed\\r\\nnothing to her. “How can you ask about Dry Coulter when we are in\\r\\nParis!” Richard laughed and Anne added at once: “Oh, I went with your\\r\\nfather and mother and Rachel to see the new cottages, and the site for\\r\\nthe hotel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What hotel?” asked Richard, but while Anne was explaining she did\\r\\nnot notice the look of anxiety on his face, for she was too much\\r\\ntaken up with looking out of the taxi window. Soon she was asking\\r\\nquestions: “What is that building? that street? that monument?” and\\r\\nwas astonished that neither Richard nor his friend could tell her.\\r\\nShe would have liked to spend hours driving about Paris, feeling Mr.\\r\\nGrandison’s gaze fixed upon her, and aware of the slight flush on her\\r\\nown cheek, but suddenly they rattled over a bridge and had turned into\\r\\na narrow lane.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have taken a room for you here,” said Richard as they drew up. “You\\r\\nget your breakfast in your room, and an evening meal for about four\\r\\nshillings a day. I took it for a week. I suppose you will be staying a\\r\\nweek in Paris.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall be staying for ever,” answered Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison gave a short, loud laugh. “I like the way you said that,” he\\r\\nexclaimed, handing her suit-case out of the cab.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sleepy-looking man had opened the hotel door, and was taking her\\r\\nluggage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ll call for you this evening, and take you out to dinner if that\\r\\nwould suit you,” said Richard; and the next moment the taxi began to\\r\\nmove off and she found herself alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall like Mr. Grandison,” she said as she followed the doorkeeper\\r\\nupstairs, and the excitement of looking at her room was mingled with\\r\\nthe excitement of imagining that in a few days she would be laughing\\r\\nwith the handsome man who had met her, and that he would lose his\\r\\nsurliness and his shyness as they walked through Paris side by side.\\r\\nBy the time she had finished unpacking she felt tired, and she lay\\r\\ndown on the bed to rest. She could not sleep, and an hour later, when\\r\\nshe looked out of the window and saw that the sunlight, which had\\r\\ngreeted her on her arrival, had given place to driving rain. She had no\\r\\numbrella, nor mackintosh, so she could not go out, and she felt shy and\\r\\nuncomfortable as she walked through the passages of the hotel. When she\\r\\ntried to speak to the chambermaid she found that she had forgotten her\\r\\nfew words of French, but at last the day passed by and she was called\\r\\nfrom her room to find Mr. Grandison waiting for her in the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Richard sent me: he will meet us in the restaurant,” he said. They got\\r\\ninto a cab, for it was still raining, and drove in silence until Anne,\\r\\nlooking out of the window, asked what street they were in. “I don’t\\r\\nknow,” answered the young man. “There are so many streets in Paris. But\\r\\nit is quite easy to find one’s way about.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne would have liked to ask him about his sister, but she lacked the\\r\\ncourage and nothing more was said. The restaurant to which they had\\r\\ndriven was like a hundred others which they had passed on the way,\\r\\nand appeared indistinguishable from the restaurants on either side of\\r\\nit; each with basket-work chairs heaped upside down on the little iron\\r\\ntables outside, with an awning flapping in the wind, and “Brasserie”\\r\\nwritten in gigantic letters along the front. It was still raining, but\\r\\nwhen they had passed through the doors they found the room was crowded.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard was waiting for them at a corner table, and they sat down. Soon\\r\\nfood was brought them, and Richard began to speak about the restaurant,\\r\\nbut Anne hardly took in his words and forgot to help herself from the\\r\\nlittle dishes, for she was charmed by the scene before her: the small\\r\\ntables, each with its merry party, men laughing hastily before filling\\r\\ntheir mouths with soup, swallowing it, and then laughing again as they\\r\\ntore the long rolls of bread to pieces with their fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Richard was pressing Anne to help herself, handing her the little\\r\\ndishes and filling her glass with yellow wine, then turning and\\r\\nspeaking to Grandison about some play of Ibsen’s which was being acted\\r\\nat a theatre in Paris. Anne’s pleasure was increased by knowing that\\r\\nRichard and his friend were talking of a play which she had read, and\\r\\nthat she could share in the discussion if she chose, but her attention\\r\\nwandered once more, and she was the first to notice a girl who came\\r\\ntowards them threading her way between the tables, followed by a fat\\r\\nman with a square red beard, who stopped to speak to some acquaintances\\r\\nwho hailed him as he passed. But the girl came on and held out a cool\\r\\nbrown hand for Anne to shake.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mademoiselle Lariboisière--always called Ginette,” said Richard.\\r\\nGinette was beautiful, very beautiful, and Anne wondered how the\\r\\nmistake had arisen which had made her expect Ginette to be Mr.\\r\\nGrandison’s sister. Instead of that she was a Frenchwoman with a lean\\r\\nbrown face like a mask and dark hazel eyes with black lashes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I were only like Ginette,” she thought, a wish that recurred for\\r\\nmany days afterwards whenever she was in her company, never guessing\\r\\nthat the French girl was saying to herself: “If I were only like this\\r\\nEnglish girl of Richard’s!”\\r\\n\\r\\nGinette sat down opposite them without appearing surprised that Richard\\r\\nand Gerald should go on talking in English and pay no attention to her,\\r\\ninterrupting each other, laughing at one moment and becoming almost\\r\\nangry in the next. But though they were talking in English, Anne did\\r\\nnot listen either; she gazed across the table at Ginette, wishing that\\r\\nshe could speak to her and get to know her. At last the meal was over,\\r\\nthe dishes were cleared away and soon they were joined by the fat man,\\r\\nin spite of all appearances an American.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne found that he was kissing her hand, and a drop of soup from his\\r\\nbeard was smeared over her fingers. Her face showed her disgust as she\\r\\njumped up from her seat, and without speaking to the American, who had\\r\\ndrawn a chair near her, she went over to Ginette. But Ginette did not\\r\\nunderstand English, and after one or two halting sentences Anne fell\\r\\ninto silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group round the table was joined by several people, and each\\r\\nnewcomer shook hands all round the table before sitting down. Anne\\r\\nhad never shaken hands so often in her life, but there was no more\\r\\nhand-kissing and there were no more beards. A Chinaman seated himself\\r\\nbeside Ginette, and they spoke so slowly that Anne was able to\\r\\nfollow their conversation; and she was astonished that she had heard\\r\\neverything they said on the lips of English curates at tea parties\\r\\nin English parsonages. After a little while Grandison came and sat\\r\\nbeside her and poured her out a glass of something warm, perfumed and\\r\\nsticky; it seemed the most delicious liquid that she had ever tasted.\\r\\nConversation flowed on all sides of her, but she sat quiet, saying\\r\\nnothing and looking at the pink face and the fair hair of Richard’s\\r\\nfriend and then at the Chinaman, who was talking so quietly and so\\r\\ntediously about the fatigues of railway journeys to Ginette, both of\\r\\nthem indifferent to the shouting, excited group clustered round Richard\\r\\nand the red-bearded American. Anne did not gather what the subject\\r\\nof their argument was and she felt no desire to do anything. An hour\\r\\npassed and then another hour, and once Grandison called to the waiter,\\r\\nwho refilled her little glass with the liqueur. It was enough for her\\r\\nto know that she was in Paris, and that this was her welcome. The\\r\\nvoices, the faces, the Chinaman and Ginette melted into a dream full\\r\\nof colour and of movement and shot through with music; her head nodded\\r\\nand when Grandison touched her on the shoulder she smiled at him and\\r\\nrealized that she was very tired.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to go to bed,” she said. “Will you please tell me the address\\r\\nof my hotel?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll see you home,” he said. “Richard is set now; he will stay here\\r\\nfor hours.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had stopped raining, and they walked. The streets gleamed, and they\\r\\nturned into a great open place filled with trees and people sauntering\\r\\nunder them. Men in groups were talking and laughing, pretty girls and\\r\\npainted women flashed their golden teeth as they passed by.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How beautiful a town is,” Anne said, almost unconscious that she was\\r\\nspeaking aloud. “But I shall never be at home in one. The stones of the\\r\\nstreets frighten me. I love the garden where:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Stumbling on melons as I pass\\r\\n  Insnared with flowers, I fall on grass,\\r\\n  Annihilating all that’s made\\r\\n  To a green thought in a green shade.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused for a moment, stumbled with sleepiness and took Grandison’s\\r\\narm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The crowd here is so thick,” she continued. “The faces search one’s\\r\\nface, the eyes meet one’s eyes, yet they all seem to be looking for\\r\\nsomeone they can never find.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked on slowly for some way in silence, but at last she spoke\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe everyone here is pursuing a dream, just as I pursued a dream\\r\\nwalking under the elms at home; they speak to each other and pass on,\\r\\nbut they never know each other. Man is always alone. They speak to each\\r\\nother, their eyes meet and sparkle; they smile and take each other\\r\\nby the arm: all in a dream. Here am I walking beside you, both of us\\r\\nare dreaming, unable to awake or to speak to each other.” There was\\r\\na pause; Grandison did not contradict what she had said, and then she\\r\\nmurmured, more to herself than to him: “I am utterly alone, but so is\\r\\neverybody else.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey continued walking for a long way through deserted streets. Anne\\r\\nwas feeling depressed by her train of thought, and Grandison was\\r\\nsilent, but when at last they reached the Rue de Beaune she felt as if\\r\\nhe had spoken and she had understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey shook hands, he looked into her eyes, cleared his throat as if he\\r\\nwere going to speak, swallowed something, but then turned away without\\r\\na word.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was wrong,” Anne said, feeling her heart filled once more with hope.\\r\\n“There is patience and nobility and honesty and faithfulness in the\\r\\nworld.” As she dropped asleep it seemed to her that these qualities\\r\\nwere inseparable from blue eyes and fair hair and fresh, blunt\\r\\nfeatures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRTEEN: PARIS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day, when she got up, Anne said to herself that she must see\\r\\nRichard at once to discuss her plans with him. But the beauty of the\\r\\nday tempted her to explore Paris. The morning was spent happily in\\r\\nlooking into the windows of the shops in the Rue de Rivoli and in\\r\\nbuying herself an umbrella; then she lunched alone, thinking that\\r\\nit would be better to reach the studio in the afternoon. But it was\\r\\nalready late before she found Montmartre, and when at last she had\\r\\nmounted the staircase and had rung the bell she was prepared for\\r\\nRichard to be out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A day wasted,” she said to herself, but in her heart she felt that it\\r\\nhad been well spent, wishing that she could spend another day and then\\r\\nanother in wandering about Paris. In the evening she had dinner at her\\r\\nhotel, and then went out once more to see the town by night.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can never get lost in Paris so long as I can find the river, for if\\r\\nI follow the river sooner or later I must come to the Pont Royal, and\\r\\nfrom there it is but a step to my hotel.” She walked along the quays\\r\\nfor some little way, but the Place de la Concorde tempted her with its\\r\\nwide expanse, and presently she found herself under the trees of the\\r\\nChamps Elysées. The clouds parted and the moonlight shone through the\\r\\nyoung leaves, a few dark figures moved in the shadows, and a band of\\r\\nyoung men passed her humming a foxtrot. Anne stopped for a moment and\\r\\nwaved her arms with a sense of freedom and then strode rapidly up the\\r\\nhill.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Étoile she turned to the left down an avenue, which she guessed\\r\\nwould bring her to the river, and when she saw the moonlight shining\\r\\nover the water she cried aloud: “I am free. I can do what I like; I can\\r\\nlive how I like. I may never see Richard or his friend or anyone I have\\r\\never met, again. I have no friends in the world. Nobody can interfere\\r\\nnow with my happy life!” And suddenly, as she gazed over the water,\\r\\nAnne remembered how she had wept in her bedroom on the morning when\\r\\nthe ploughmen had come. “No need for tears now that the accursed chain\\r\\nis broken. Who would guess, meeting me here, that I was the vicar’s\\r\\ndaughter with no hope of escaping from the parish? I am still alone,\\r\\nabsolutely alone, but I care nothing for that because I am free. I\\r\\nam free!” she repeated in a loud voice which startled her, but there\\r\\nwas no one near her, and she set off along the bank of the river.\\r\\n“I shall never go back!” she said, drawing herself up proudly, then,\\r\\nlooking at the water, she wished that she could bathe, and her gaiety\\r\\nand irresponsibility were such that she was almost on the point of\\r\\nundressing beneath a lamp-post and plunging in. She recollected in time\\r\\nthat she would be saved by a French policeman, and walked on laughing\\r\\nas she pictured to herself the explanations that she would offer next\\r\\nmorning in the police-court in her broken French.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Richard would never forgive me if I dragged him to a police-court,”\\r\\nshe said, and her thoughts went back to her father. “Strange how blind\\r\\nI was, thinking that he needed me when he welcomed my going. But, who\\r\\nknows? he may be missing me now.” She turned back when she had reached\\r\\nSt. Cloud and retraced her footsteps easily; in less than an hour she\\r\\nhad reached the Pont Royal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have done something that no respectable girl should do,” she said as\\r\\nshe went up to her room. “I have run the risk of being spoken to in the\\r\\nstreet. Apparently I am not attractive enough to be in any danger from\\r\\nthe vicious,” she added as she looked in the glass, but she was pleased\\r\\nwith what she saw there and fell asleep at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a letter from Richard waiting for her asking her to luncheon\\r\\nthe following day, and when the time came Anne was overjoyed to see a\\r\\nfamiliar face once more, though she had been repeating to herself the\\r\\nwords she had spoken by the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door of the studio was opened by Ginette, who held out a cool hand.\\r\\nAs the girl turned to lead her in, Anne looked at the dark head with\\r\\nthe short black hairs cropped close to the brown neck and such envy\\r\\nfilled her at the sight that she nearly burst into tears. To be cool\\r\\nand dark and brown, to live in a studio with two men, to talk French,\\r\\nsuch were the hopeless ambitions which filled her heart. Grandison got\\r\\nup from his chair as she came in but he said nothing, only bowed and\\r\\nsat down again with his eyes on her face. Richard was washing his hands\\r\\nin the corner. “Don’t come near me, Anne, I am covered with paint,” he\\r\\ncalled out, but his voice sounded friendly as though he were glad to\\r\\nsee her.\\r\\n\\r\\nGinette laid her hand on her shoulder:\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are very beautiful,” she brought out laboriously. She had been\\r\\npractising the phrase all the morning, and the unexpected words set\\r\\nAnne blushing with pleasure. “Richard has said much of you but not that\\r\\nyou are beautiful. He is bad.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s blush was a blush of happiness, and she caught the French girl\\r\\nby the hand and pressed it. Ginette laughed and raised her eyebrows,\\r\\nand would have spoken if they had not been startled by Grandison, who\\r\\nordered them to sit down to luncheon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have brought some of the drawings I did for fashion plates to show\\r\\nyou,” said Anne, but Richard did not refer to them when the meal was\\r\\nover; he seemed more interested in Dry Coulter than in Paris, and began\\r\\nto speak of the village while his companions sat in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have heard from Rachel: she is very excited as she is going to\\r\\nbe chosen Queen of the May. You know May-day is even more of an\\r\\ninstitution than Plough Monday,” he said, turning towards Grandison.\\r\\n“It is celebrated more pleasantly in an English village than in Paris.”\\r\\nAnd Richard began to describe how five little girls were chosen, of\\r\\nwhom Rachel would be the leader, to go from house to house carrying an\\r\\narbour of flowers and singing whatever songs they happened to know.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The arbour is made of cowslips and may, with a few of the early purple\\r\\norchids,” said Anne, calling up the memory of May-day a year ago. “It\\r\\nwas raining when they came to the vicarage and they wore yellow ribbons\\r\\nand sang ‘Ta ra ra Boom de ay.’ I opened the door and they went on\\r\\nsinging without paying any attention to the sixpence I held out to\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That sixpence went to the chapel Sunday School Treat,” said Richard.\\r\\n“Paganism has been made respectable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What will Rachel wear as the May Queen?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She speaks of a wreath of pansies if there are enough of them out to\\r\\nmake it; her companions will have chaplets of forget-me-nots, and they\\r\\nwill carry the bower while she carries an armful of tulips. She did not\\r\\nspeak of her dress, but of course it will be a white one, and they will\\r\\nwear black worsted stockings and solid little hobnailed boots laced\\r\\nhigh up the leg.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rachel doesn’t worry about her boots,” said Anne at once, and her\\r\\nthoughts flew back to Mr. Yockney, then she looked round the studio\\r\\nthinking that the rent was paid out of the grocer’s shop at home. “I\\r\\nthink Rachel’s perfectly happy. I think all your family are,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So they ought to be,” said Richard, laughing. “See what a good son\\r\\nI am. I give my father an object in life, which is more than any of\\r\\nyou do. He is very happy and proud of me. In the old days of course,”\\r\\nRichard went on, “the first of May was a great affair, with a maypole\\r\\nset up and a Jack of the Green. The May Queen was not a little girl in\\r\\nthose days. You would have been chosen instead of Rachel and, having\\r\\nbeen kissed by all the boys in the village, you would have got rid of\\r\\nyour obsession about never getting to know anyone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne blushed uncomfortably, and looked at Grandison, who must, she\\r\\nthought, have repeated what she had said while he was seeing her home.\\r\\n“An obsession about never getting to know anyone!” and she wondered if\\r\\nRichard had summed her up for ever in these unkind words.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I expect the maze was laid out on a May-day,” said Richard, “and the\\r\\nmonument is nothing more than a stone maypole, or something with the\\r\\nsame signification.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can tell you about the monument,” said Anne. “It commemorates the\\r\\nrestoration of Charles II, and was put up by a young man of nineteen,\\r\\nwho must have come back from France with the King and recovered his\\r\\nsequestered estate:--a small enough one, I should guess, and the Old\\r\\nHall. I suppose the maze might have been cut on a May-day, and no doubt\\r\\nthey had a maypole on the green again: they had been put down under\\r\\nthe Commonwealth, but I doubt if there were many to dance. All the\\r\\nbetter people had served in Cromwell’s regiments. Except in Huntingdon\\r\\nitself, they were all Puritans.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then we must imagine your young cavalier setting up a maypole on the\\r\\ngreen and dancing with gypsy girls and all the riff-raff he could\\r\\nassemble, while the village people held aloof under the elm trees round\\r\\nthe edges of the green and prayed for a thunderstorm,” said Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There were oak trees in those days, not elms,” said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know that?” he asked her sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew positively, but she had forgotten how she knew and, as she\\r\\nrepeated that she was sure, she felt that she must seem very stupid to\\r\\nMr. Grandison.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, he danced in a scarlet coat with lace ruffles, which he\\r\\nhad brought back from France, with the gipsy girls in their rags,\\r\\nand Maggie Pattle joined in for the sake of the beer, but all the\\r\\nrespectable tenants stood under the oak trees looking glum and hating\\r\\nhim. But how do you explain that the monument is still standing and\\r\\nthat, though it is the most striking thing in the village, nobody ever\\r\\nlooks at it or knows anything about it? If one asks a question they\\r\\njust shake their heads and change the conversation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The young cavalier lived to be eighty-eight,” answered Anne. “It is\\r\\nnatural that nobody would dare disturb his maze while he was living,\\r\\nor to pull down the stone column sculptured with his arms. All the\\r\\nPuritans were dead before he was, and the significance of the monument\\r\\nwas forgotten by 1729.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the civil war isn’t forgotten,” said Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have often heard a villager say when someone has got into trouble\\r\\nfor poaching hares: ‘We want another of the Cromwells in this country.\\r\\nThere were no game laws in Nolly’s time.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I expect there is a tradition that the maze represents something out\\r\\nof harmony with the village: they have ignored it for so long that they\\r\\nhave forgotten everything except that it is something which ought to be\\r\\nignored,” said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard agreed with her, and an hour passed before she remembered the\\r\\ndrawings she had brought to show him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Leave them for me to look at,” said Richard, but she would not be\\r\\nput off. As she untied the portfolio she felt that her fingers were\\r\\ntrembling, and she became confused as she explained that she knew her\\r\\ndrawings were not fashionable: she had done them at Dry Coulter in\\r\\nignorance of what the latest fashions might be, thinking that they\\r\\nwould serve as specimens to show her workmanship. Instead of explaining\\r\\nthis clearly, what she said was something very silly, but Richard did\\r\\nnot smile at her absurdity, and there was an absolute silence as she\\r\\nlaid the first of the drawings on the table, propping it up against a\\r\\nwine bottle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long while Richard Sotheby stood wrinkling his nose and Gerald\\r\\nand Ginette stood silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the next,” said Richard sharply, but, going to the portfolio\\r\\nhimself, he turned over the other drawings rapidly. There was a silence\\r\\nagain as he carefully fastened the clasp of the portfolio, and then\\r\\nturned and walked a few steps away. Suddenly, however, he began to\\r\\nspeak, and the words fell so rapidly that Anne could scarcely follow\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dress designers are very stupid people,” he began. “Don’t be\\r\\ndiscouraged when I advise you not to show these actual drawings.\\r\\nIn order to create an impression you must first obtain a thorough\\r\\nknowledge of the mode. There is just as much fashion in the drawings of\\r\\ndresses as in the dresses themselves. What would have been all right\\r\\nlast year or the year before is quite out of date now.” And he began to\\r\\nexplain very rapidly what these changes in styles of drawing had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted suddenly by Ginette. Anne could not follow her\\r\\nwords, but she noticed Grandison nod his head vigorously and say:\\r\\n“An excellent idea,” while an expression of exasperation came over\\r\\nRichard’s white face.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he turned to Anne she felt a sudden conviction that her drawings\\r\\nwere bad and that Richard was concealing his opinion of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ginette is of the opinion that you are the right figure, and that you\\r\\nhave acquired, Heaven knows how, the right appearance for a mannequin.\\r\\nShe wants to introduce you to a man she knows who works in one of the\\r\\nwholesale houses. I think that you would dislike such a life and would\\r\\nsoon wish that you were back in England. But don’t despair about your\\r\\ndrawings,” he added, almost shouting the last words.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne took up her portfolio, turning Ginette’s advice over in her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How should I get a job as a mannequin?” she asked, but an argument\\r\\nhad broken out between Richard and Ginette and her question went\\r\\nfor some time unanswered. At last he turned from the French girl in\\r\\nexasperation, and she repeated her question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ginette will let you know,” he said. “Come to tea to-morrow at five\\r\\no’clock.” The tone of the invitation was so cross that Anne said\\r\\ngood-bye at once. Grandison had scarcely spoken a word during the\\r\\ndiscussion, but as she left the room he made a gesture as if he would\\r\\nspeak, but he said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What have I done to upset them all so much?” she asked herself as\\r\\nshe hurried down the stairs, but she could find no answer. Richard’s\\r\\nwords had been encouraging, yet she was tempted to tear up her wretched\\r\\ndrawings then and there.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, my fashion plates are hopeless,” she said to herself, but she\\r\\nfound it hard to understand why Richard should have been so exasperated\\r\\nby Ginette’s suggestion. “If my drawings are no good I must find some\\r\\nother way of earning my living. Richard would keep me in a fool’s\\r\\nparadise until my money is exhausted.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer train of thought was interrupted by the sound of footsteps, and she\\r\\nheard a voice calling her. It was Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I meant to ask you: if you are short of money, let me lend you ten\\r\\npounds. You must have time to look about you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne stared at him in surprise. He was very white; out of breath with\\r\\nrunning and his words came with an effort, but his tone was still one\\r\\nof exasperation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” she said, looking him in the eyes. “Thank you, I have\\r\\nstill seventeen pounds.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, later on,” answered Richard. “Whenever you want a loan, come\\r\\nto me. While one has money it is one’s duty to share it. That is what\\r\\nGrandison and I believe, and after all you and I come from the same\\r\\nvillage.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter saying this he turned round and walked back, quietly cursing her\\r\\nexistence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOURTEEN: A REMOVAL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“How could I ever have imagined that I was in love with Richard\\r\\nSotheby?” Anne asked herself in astonishment as she walked back across\\r\\nParis. “It turns out I don’t love him enough to borrow money from him.\\r\\nHe would always behave well, he would always be kind, yet I think he\\r\\nwould be delighted if he were never to see me again. I shall never ask\\r\\nhim for help or for advice; I shall never go near his studio after\\r\\nto-morrow.” And it occurred to her suddenly that the money he had\\r\\noffered to lend her had been earned by his father, and that it might\\r\\nhave been spent on Rachel, or on the Temperance Hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wonder why it is that Ginette loves him?” she asked herself. “If she\\r\\nreally does. If I were her I should lose my heart to Mr. Grandison.”\\r\\nAnd saying this she recalled the look in Grandison’s eyes and how he\\r\\nhad kept them fixed on her, how he had seemed to be going to speak and\\r\\nthe gesture with which he had sunk back into his chair as she went out\\r\\nof the studio. “Richard has robbed me of knowing him. We should easily\\r\\nhave become intimate, we should have been friends,” she said with her\\r\\nheart full of bitterness. Every detail of her walk with Grandison came\\r\\nback and hurt her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I am to be a mannequin if they like my figure.” The more she\\r\\nthought of Ginette’s suggestion the better she liked it, and the more\\r\\ndifficult she found it to understand Richard’s annoyance. She was\\r\\npuzzled to find an explanation, and tried one theory after another, but\\r\\nnothing she could imagine seemed to her probable, and when five o’clock\\r\\ncame on the following afternoon she had almost persuaded herself\\r\\nthat the explanation of Richard’s ill-humour must be something quite\\r\\nunconnected with herself. She knocked and Richard opened the door, and\\r\\nstood for a moment in the threshold before admitting her. He stared at\\r\\nher with a grin on his face and said: “Oh! So it is you, Anne!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Weren’t you expecting me?” she asked, noticing his surprise. “You said\\r\\nI was to come to tea.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Sotheby led her into the studio, and Ginette rose from the\\r\\nsofa, where she had been lying. The girl’s face had changed; Anne\\r\\ncould see that she had been crying, but there was so much pride in her\\r\\ngreeting that she felt shy of looking her in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here is a letter for you,” said Ginette gravely, speaking in French\\r\\nand pronouncing her words with the greatest distinctness. “You are to\\r\\npresent it personally to M. Kieselyov at that address at eight o’clock\\r\\nto-morrow morning. If he thinks you are in the English style he will\\r\\nengage you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you with all my heart. Your goodness....” Ginette did not wait\\r\\nfor Anne to finish her sentence, but walked away across the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard was making the tea. “Have you heard from your father?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I haven’t,” said Anne, feeling rather guilty. She had not written\\r\\nto him since her arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had a letter from mother with messages for you from Rachel.” He was\\r\\nhalf tempted to add that their names must be coupled together in the\\r\\nvillage by now, and that this was disagreeable to him, but he looked at\\r\\nAnne and refrained.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had taken off her hat, and the short, closely cropped hair shone\\r\\nlike straw. There was a worried look on her pale face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My God, what innocence!” he said to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ginette and Richard have been quarrelling,” thought Anne, wondering if\\r\\nGrandison would come in, for she was miserably disappointed not to see\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut instead of asking if he would be back to tea she said: “I wonder if\\r\\nthe swallows are building again in our dove house.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do they build there?” asked Richard, and the whole expression of his\\r\\nface altered at her words.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, they have a nest on the joist. Father leaves the top half of the\\r\\ndoor open for them and they fly in and out. They are the prettiest\\r\\nof the birds; my favourites, for no birds exceed them in loveliness\\r\\nof colouring: the steel-blue back, the crimson throat and the white\\r\\nbelly. The flight of the swallow is more beautiful than that of any\\r\\nother bird, but this pair are prettiest when they sit side by side on\\r\\nthe rails outside the dove house. Their spirits always seem to me a\\r\\nlittle low: she moves one wing and then the other, as though she were\\r\\nshrugging her little shoulders, and then, suddenly, he bursts into\\r\\nsong. Do you know the swallows’ song?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said Richard. “I have never heard a swallow sing.” He sat down\\r\\nand buried his face in his hands, and repeated in tones of utter\\r\\nwretchedness: “No, I have never heard a swallow sing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has the clear note of a contralto; not loud or defiant, nor yet\\r\\nfeeble, but full of love, subdued because he can never forget that the\\r\\nworld is full of cruelty and unkindness.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGinette broke in with a question as to what Anne had said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard told her, and the French girl smiled wearily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In England it is only the swallows apparently which have discovered\\r\\nsuch platitudes.” Then she added: “Why is she staying?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It appears we invited her to tea,” answered Richard in a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was the sound of a heavy tramp on the stairs and then a knock.\\r\\nRichard stood up and went to the door. Anne looked across at Ginette\\r\\nand saw that she was gazing at her with a strange expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must go,” she said to herself. “Why does she look at me as if she\\r\\nfelt contempt for me?” But it seemed impossible to go after that look\\r\\nwithout an explanation. The memory of that expression would haunt her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked up and saw that Richard had come back from the door, and\\r\\nthat a workman had followed him, and together they crossed the studio\\r\\nand disappeared into the little room at the back.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne sat and sipped her tea, tortured by the need to speak, to ask\\r\\na question, to see light, and by the desire to escape, to go out of\\r\\nthe studio and never to set foot in it again. But she could not find\\r\\nthe words with which to ask her question or to take her leave, and\\r\\nshe sat on, dumbly watching the workman crossing the room, first with\\r\\na rolled-up mattress in his arms and then with a little folding bed\\r\\nor carrying a wash-hand-stand. Richard came back and threw himself\\r\\ndown in a chair. There was a silence, prolonged until the workman\\r\\nreappeared, crossed the studio and went out once more with a chair and\\r\\na looking-glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nGinette gave Richard an appealing look and he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anne, I think perhaps you had better go now. Ginette and I are both\\r\\nrather upset.” He paused for a moment and said in colourless tones:\\r\\n“Besides, someone who wishes to see you is waiting.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne rose. “Good-bye, Mademoiselle Lariboisière,” she said, holding out\\r\\nher hand. The brown hand gripped hers firmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Till we meet again,” she said, and then added in broken English: “You\\r\\nhave a lucky face.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you for telling me about the swallows,” said Richard as he\\r\\nstood above her at the top of the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French workman was struggling with a small table on the staircase\\r\\nand it was some moments before she could reach the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never to know the meaning! Never to learn the secret! Never to\\r\\nunderstand anything at all!” Anne cried with tears coming into her\\r\\neyes. “I have never seen into another person’s heart. I never shall.\\r\\nWherever I am, my curse clings to me!” A vague project of suicide,\\r\\nof being found floating in the river, passed through her mind as she\\r\\nstepped out into the street. The workman was still in front of her\\r\\nlifting the table into a small motor-van; in avoiding him she ran into\\r\\nGrandison’s back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good God! You here! Don’t go away!” he exclaimed, as though she was\\r\\nrunning from him. Anne stepped back and stood for a moment staring in\\r\\nastonishment into his red face.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis words sounded angry, and his blue eyes glittered angrily so that\\r\\nshe felt afraid and her first impulse was to run back into the house.\\r\\n“I cannot go up there again,” flashed through her mind, and she turned\\r\\nagain to Grandison.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Miss Dunnock,” said the young man, still looking at her, almost\\r\\nmurderously. “I must make an explanation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word explanation caught her ears. “No, that is impossible,” she\\r\\nsaid to herself for some reason. “An explanation is impossible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t understand,” she said in a weak voice, giving up all thoughts\\r\\nof flight. She was almost in tears. “I don’t understand anything.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison’s anger or passion seemed suddenly to have completely\\r\\ndisappeared. He looked at her appealingly with an expression in which\\r\\nshe could read pity for her and misery on his own account. For a moment\\r\\nhe tried to speak and choked, and then, swallowing, went on rapidly:\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is rather complicated. I am taking away my furniture to a new room\\r\\nand must superintend the man unpacking it. If you could come with me in\\r\\nthe van we could talk to each other.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe van was packed; the man was waiting, impatient of their\\r\\nconversation. Anne did not hesitate, but scrambled up on to the\\r\\ntail-board of the van and settled herself on the rolled-up mattress.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was excited without knowing why, and suddenly, looking at Grandison\\r\\nperched beside her on the edge of the wash-hand-stand, she felt happy\\r\\nand secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to explain,” he said suddenly, as though he were defending\\r\\nhimself. “This is my furniture. I am taking it away from the studio\\r\\nbecause I cannot live with Richard or with Ginette any longer. I have\\r\\nbroken with them completely, and have taken a room of my own.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was so much suffering in his voice that Anne understood that\\r\\nthere had been a quarrel. At that moment all seemed suddenly to have\\r\\nbecome clear to her, and she felt that she was a very experienced\\r\\nperson. “What foolishness!” she exclaimed to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why should they have quarrelled?” And she decided to persuade\\r\\nGrandison to turn back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you want to leave them?” she asked gently. She was preparing\\r\\nto reason with him sympathetically, and softly to lead him back to\\r\\nRichard. For a moment Grandison sat silent, and something in his sullen\\r\\nexpression, his trembling lip and the way in which he opened and then\\r\\nshut his hand, moved her very much.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must explain,” he repeated. “Ever since I met you at the station I\\r\\nhave been madly in love with you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne felt cold all over as she heard these words; she shivered and\\r\\ngazed at Grandison with frightened eyes, asking herself if she had\\r\\nheard what he had said aright; a suspicion crossed her mind that he was\\r\\nplaying a joke on her, a heartless practical joke. She gazed at him in\\r\\nterror, but he went on without turning his head to look at her: “It\\r\\nhas been awful. I could not speak to you while I was still living in\\r\\nRichard’s studio. I think Ginette guessed but Richard did not suspect\\r\\nuntil I told him after you went yesterday. I did not think it would\\r\\nupset him so much or that it would upset me so much.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t understand why he should be upset or why he dislikes me, but\\r\\nI feel he does. There has never been anything between Richard and me,”\\r\\nsaid Anne. She stopped, feeling that she had said something foolish.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know, but there has been a great deal between Richard and me,”\\r\\nanswered Grandison. “Just now he hates you, though it is not your fault\\r\\nthat I am in love with you, and he knows that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has got Ginette,” said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, my God!” cried Grandison, making the most awful face. “Ginette was\\r\\nmy mistress. Surely you knew that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne gazed at the cuff of Grandison’s coat: a check material with a\\r\\nlittle wavy thread of purple running among the fawns and greys. She was\\r\\novercome with shame and confusion at her ignorance and her stupidity.\\r\\nThere was a long silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This doesn’t seem like a trick,” she said to herself, but the fear\\r\\nthat Grandison might in some way be playing some strange and terrible\\r\\njoke at her expense remained at the back of her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For some reason I thought that Ginette and you were the same person\\r\\nbefore I arrived,” she said. “You see I overheard Richard spelling out\\r\\na telegram to you in French before I had ever spoken to him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A telegram?” Grandison asked in astonishment. “Oh, yes, perhaps he\\r\\ndid telegraph. I wrote and told him that I was in love with Ginette\\r\\nand that I proposed taking her to live with us.... That was a dreadful\\r\\nthing to have done. You see, Richard was very fond of me; he cares\\r\\nabout nobody else,” he said suddenly, wiping the sweat off his forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have always, all my life, mismanaged my love affairs. But that is\\r\\nbecause I have never been in love before. Now I am in love with you\\r\\nand I determined not to mismanage that but to make a clean sweep of\\r\\neverything.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis remark, and the defiant tone in which it was uttered, struck Anne\\r\\nas comic; she laughed but immediately regretted having done so, for\\r\\nGrandison burst into tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had never seen a man weep before and was alarmed. The tears\\r\\nstreamed down his cheeks and hung on the stubble of his beard, for\\r\\nhe had not shaved that day, and then fell one after another on to his\\r\\nknees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne jumped up from the mattress, hitting her head on the top of the\\r\\nvan. “Oh! Damn!” She clutched Grandison round the shoulders while\\r\\nher eyes filled with tears from the pain. “Don’t cry; I have hit my\\r\\nhead such an awful crack, but you see I am not crying,” she said,\\r\\nhugging him and then slipping on to her knees. He looked at her, and\\r\\nthe van pulled up with a jerk just as they found each other’s faces\\r\\nin a kiss. They alighted, and Grandison led the way into the meanest\\r\\nbuilding that Anne had ever seen. His room was on the top floor, and\\r\\nas they ascended, an odour of cooking, of accumulated filth, of bugs\\r\\nand of boiled rags took them by the throat. But they climbed on, up\\r\\nand up, and behind them toiled the indignant workman, sweating under\\r\\nthe mattress in his arms, and pausing to curse the smells and the\\r\\nfilthiness of the house under his breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The view is magnificent,” said Grandison with a sweep of his arm as he\\r\\nthrew open the door of a tiny attic.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Put the things down anywhere, just as you like,” he added to the\\r\\nworkman. He was right, the view was magnificent. All Paris lay\\r\\nglittering at their feet in the sunshine, and Anne forgot the\\r\\nmalodorous staircase as she leant out of the open window.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, the view is lovely,” she said, turning to Grandison, but an\\r\\naltercation was going on with the workman, who was repeating again and\\r\\nagain: “This place stinks.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison could understand the words well enough, but he was offended\\r\\nand resolutely shrugged his shoulders, repeating: “Don’t understand.\\r\\nFetch my furniture.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This place stinks,” repeated the workman with appropriate gestures.\\r\\n“It gives me a bad throat.” He made sounds as if he were going to be\\r\\nsick.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t understand what you say; fetch the furniture,” repeated\\r\\nGrandison in a rage, and began to push the man out of the room. “A\\r\\nhouse full of Poles and bugs,” said the man as he made off down the\\r\\nstaircase.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s quite an accident,” said Grandison, “that there is such a\\r\\nwonderful view. I took the first room I could find, by candle light. It\\r\\nis dirty, but I had it scrubbed out with disinfectant this morning. I\\r\\nshall get some sulphur candles in case what he says about the bugs is\\r\\ntrue.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne sniffed: a smell of Jeyes fluid hung in the air. They were silent,\\r\\ngazing out of the window, waiting while the slow tramp of feet and\\r\\nmuttered curses drew nearer and the man came in carrying the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It stinks,” he announced, returning to Richard.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison cursed suddenly with great obscenity in fluent French.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mustn’t talk to me like that,” answered the man, but he left the\\r\\nroom after looking at Anne with an air of icy disapproval. “Damn the\\r\\nfellow,” said Grandison, and they remained silent while the table, the\\r\\nwash-hand-stand, a piece of drugget and the chairs were brought in.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison had recovered his temper by then, and gave the man a tip.\\r\\n“One doesn’t say such things,” said the workman, pocketing it, and he\\r\\nwent down the stairs clearing his throat. They listened to the tramp\\r\\nof feet descending the stairs without looking at each other, and stood\\r\\nmotionless through the minutes of dead silence which followed. “He must\\r\\nbe waiting and poking about in the hall,” was their unspoken thought\\r\\nand, exchanging a swift glance, they nodded their suspicions. A sudden\\r\\ncrash resounded up the stairs of the outer door being slammed, and they\\r\\nsmiled happily at each other, for love is impossible except in secret.\\r\\nBut although they smiled the silence continued, their hearts beating\\r\\nfaster and faster and confusion coming upon them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We must put up the bed,” said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison helped her mechanically; the pleasure of her presence near\\r\\nhim was so great that he was afraid to speak lest some word of his\\r\\nmight scare her away. Together they unfolded the legs of the narrow\\r\\niron bedstead, set it upon its feet, covered it with a weedy mattress\\r\\nand a coverlet. Then they laid the carpet on the floor, set the trunk\\r\\nin one corner, the washstand in another, and put the table in the\\r\\nmiddle of the room. There was nothing more to be done, and after\\r\\nspeaking once or twice of buying such necessaries as a broom and a\\r\\nlooking-glass, they became silent again, Anne sitting in the only\\r\\nchair, Grandison upon the bed, while darkness closed in on them very\\r\\nslowly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed to the girl then that at last she had found what she had been\\r\\nseeking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have found this room,” she said to herself, and already she was at\\r\\nhome in it, and she sat musing over the vast landscape of the future,\\r\\nof which she had suddenly caught a glimpse as she had of Paris itself,\\r\\nbut without knowledge and unable to recognize the landmarks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at last, rousing herself, she looked about her and asked suddenly:\\r\\n“How will you paint in such a small room?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know,” he answered. “I only paint because Richard does.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It has got dark,” she said. “I can’t see your face.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe struck a match and they looked at each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t got a candle,” he said apologetically. “And there is no gas.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne rose from her chair. “She is going,” Grandison said to himself\\r\\nas he stood up. Their hands touched and they embraced. “I have always\\r\\nloved you. Before I knew you. Before I knew myself, while I was still\\r\\nin the navy,” he whispered rapidly between his kisses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whispering went on and on in the dark room, lit by the flickering\\r\\narc lamps in the street below. Each whisper was a charm that breathed\\r\\nlove into her, that stole away her strength, and that changed her\\r\\nnature. Yet Anne still held herself alert, danger seemed near; at any\\r\\nmoment a heavy footstep might sound upon the stairs, a voice break in.\\r\\nIt seemed to her that if she sat very still the danger might pass, and\\r\\nwhen Grandison’s voice rose she stroked his hair nervously--hair as\\r\\nshort and thick and soft as fur.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Richard--the danger is Richard,” she said to herself, recognizing that\\r\\nshe was helpless in face of that danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nHours passed but no footstep sounded on the stairs, and no voice spoke\\r\\nout of the darkness; only the moon breaking through the clouds flooded\\r\\nthe room with light, showing them to each other. They became hungry,\\r\\nbut they forgot their hunger, remembered the passage of time and as\\r\\nsoon forgot it, grew sleepy and did not think of sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nA clock struck and they counted eleven strokes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must be hungry,” said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I am,” answered Grandison, surprised, but he took an apple from\\r\\nhis pocket, and when they had shared it their hunger seemed to be\\r\\nsatisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nA clock struck, and they lost count of the strokes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is midnight,” said Anne. “I must go back to my hotel.” But she did\\r\\nnot move, and an hour later she had consented to stay the night, had\\r\\nundressed in the dark and had got into the bed, while Grandison had\\r\\nwrapped himself in his overcoat and, covered with the piece of drugget,\\r\\nwas stretched out upon the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long while Anne went on stroking his hair, and when at last they\\r\\nfell asleep he was still grasping her hand in both of his and holding\\r\\nit to his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\nA strangled cry of “Help!” was ringing in her ears, but she understood\\r\\nthat it was her own voice that she had heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the matter, Anne?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is all right,” she answered, coming to herself, but her voice was\\r\\nfull of fear, and Grandison, sitting up by her bed, could see her\\r\\nshudder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose it was a dream,” she murmured, and suddenly the fear left\\r\\nher as the details of her nightmare came back, and she lay in silence\\r\\npiecing them together.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was something awful about my father,” she said. “I was alone,\\r\\nquite alone, in the vicarage. There was no furniture; I went from room\\r\\nto room looking for my father, but all the rooms were empty; all the\\r\\nfurniture had been taken away but they had left me behind. Suddenly I\\r\\nlooked out of the bedroom window, my father’s bedroom, for it was at\\r\\nthe front of the house, and as I expected I saw a Ford van stop at the\\r\\ngate and people getting out of it.” Anne shuddered again violently and\\r\\nGrandison began stroking her shoulder. “Don’t tell me if it frightens\\r\\nyou,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two women came first, and I was frightened of them because I could\\r\\nsee that they were imbecile from the way they walked, but I was more\\r\\nfrightened of the men. They weren’t mad but I could see madness in\\r\\ntheir faces, and I recognized them at once. They were the Puttys, who\\r\\nused to live in the Burnt Farm, but it seemed to me that they were\\r\\ncoming to our house. They looked from side to side with wooden faces,\\r\\nand I could see that underneath their woodenness they were full of\\r\\nterror. When they got to the door I could no longer see them, for I\\r\\ndared not look down on their heads, but I heard them unlock the door\\r\\nand knew that they had come to take possession. All I could do was to\\r\\nhide, and for a long while I lay holding my breath and listening as\\r\\nthey laughed and screamed and threw plates at each other downstairs.\\r\\nThen I heard the man coming up the stairs in his heavy hobnail boots. I\\r\\nheard him fumble at the door and I began to scream.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor creature,” said Grandison. “Who were these people?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Puttys; Richard’s mother told me their story: they lived at the\\r\\nBurnt Farm,” answered Anne, and stopped, realizing that her words could\\r\\nmean nothing to Grandison.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You aren’t frightened any longer, are you?” he asked, and his jaws\\r\\nwere pulled apart violently in a yawn; he shivered all over. When he\\r\\ncould speak again he repeated: “You are quite sure that you aren’t\\r\\nfrightened any longer?” He leant towards her to kiss her, but stopped,\\r\\nfeeling another yawn upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, why should I be?” she replied, and without waiting to hear what\\r\\nelse she had to say he lay down on the bare boards and was asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne’s fear had gone, but one thing still puzzled her; for though\\r\\nshe had no memory of her father in her dream she knew that it was\\r\\nterrifying because of him, not because of the Puttys.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, the subject of my dream was my father,” she repeated to herself,\\r\\nwondering suddenly what she was doing in Paris, and hearing a slight\\r\\nsnore she looked over the edge of the bed at the sleeping figure beside\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why am I here?” she thought. “This is madness!” and she determined\\r\\nto get out of bed and dress and hurry away if she could do so without\\r\\nwaking her neighbour. A minute passed while she waited for him to fall\\r\\nsound asleep, but he stirred uneasily when she sat up in bed. “I must\\r\\ngive him five minutes,” she thought. “Then I shall be rested.” She lay\\r\\nback, aware that a task awaited her which would need all her strength,\\r\\nbut before two minutes had passed she began breathing gently and was\\r\\nasleep herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFIFTEEN: HONEYMOONING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA month had passed, and in the last week of their honeymoon Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Grandison were staying at an hotel in Avignon. The sun was already\\r\\nhot when Anne came down to breakfast after waking her husband and\\r\\nleaving him to shave and to dress. The American ladies smiled at her as\\r\\nshe came into the little courtyard, bidding her: “Good morning,” and\\r\\nhoping that she had passed a pleasant night.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pleasant night! What could she answer to them? But Anne smiled\\r\\nback, and then she laughed, for she was happy to be alive, and her\\r\\nskin tingled with pleasure as she took her seat carelessly under the\\r\\nflowering oleander. A dog ran in from the street causing a diversion,\\r\\nthe cat sunning herself on the cobblestones leapt on to one of the\\r\\ntables; the dog yapped, but he was in no mood for cats, and hearing his\\r\\nmaster’s whistle he ran out again. But watching them Anne felt as much\\r\\nexcitement as if she had never seen a cat and a dog before. Her eyes\\r\\nwere still bright with interest when the waiter came up with coffee,\\r\\nand he also asked if she had slept well. On the tray there were two\\r\\nletters, one for her and one for Monsieur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first letters for three weeks! And Anne seized hers, forwarded from\\r\\nher hotel in Paris, and tore it open. It was from her father and ran as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        The Vicarage, Dry Coulter,\\r\\n                                                        Huntingdonshire.\\r\\n\\r\\n  My dear Anne,\\r\\n\\r\\n  The news of your marriage is not such a great surprise as you\\r\\n  anticipated, but it is not the less welcome because I had an inkling\\r\\n  that what moved you to fly abroad was much the same as that which\\r\\n  moves the whitethroat to fly here in summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Dear girl, I write strangely removed from you and the blessing I send\\r\\n  is a more disinterested one than parents are usually in a position to\\r\\n  give. My revelation has come to me late in life, but I am aware that\\r\\n  it has changed me greatly, so that now I find it almost impossible\\r\\n  to think of worldly things. However, I have packed up the old silver\\r\\n  teapot which was your mother’s and have had it sent to you addressed\\r\\n  to the Paris branch of our bank at Linton for greater safety....\\r\\n  You shall have the rat-tail spoons, but one seems to be mislaid.\\r\\n  Your letter was the first communication for many weeks to recall me\\r\\n  to this transient world, and to that extent I must admit that your\\r\\n  marriage caused me pain. But no, I am wrong, something else has\\r\\n  happened since you left--a sad tragedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  You will remember our little angelic visitors of the dove house,\\r\\n  so faithful to one another and so happy as they chased the summer\\r\\n  flies. You will recollect the pleasure he gave us with his song,\\r\\n  always rather saddened, whilst she brooded over her mysteries in the\\r\\n  little clay cup on the joist. Old Noah had occasion to go into the\\r\\n  upper storey of the dove house and carelessly (for it was nothing\\r\\n  but carelessness) left the hatch open. I did not notice anything for\\r\\n  several days, then, going up myself, found the swallow dead. She must\\r\\n  have flown up, attracted by the light, and have beaten her life out\\r\\n  on the window-panes. He, poor fellow, had flown away. I pray that\\r\\n  neither you nor your husband should ever know his sorrow. My best\\r\\n  regards to the gentleman with the beautiful name, your husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                       Your affectionate Father,\\r\\n                                                        CHARLES DUNNOCK.\\r\\n\\r\\n  P.S. It gives me peculiar pleasure to inscribe Mrs. Grandison on the\\r\\n  envelope.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled as she finished the letter, but her heart was troubled;\\r\\nnever before had her father been so intimate with her--never had he\\r\\nrevealed so much of himself. Her love for him came back to her, a\\r\\nsudden shock astonishing her, for it was a love of which she had hardly\\r\\nsuspected the existence, while at the same moment she thought: “He can\\r\\nafford to write to me like this now I am safely married and he is in no\\r\\ndanger of my coming back.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon her emotion passed, and she looked around her with renewed\\r\\nexcitement. “How lovely the blue sky and the blossom of the oleander!”\\r\\nThe waiter was standing beside her setting out the coffee-pot and the\\r\\nmilk jug, the cups and saucers, the two hot rolls, wrapped in napkins,\\r\\nand the four thin bricks of lustreless sugar. She picked up her\\r\\nhusband’s letter and glanced at the envelope.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How happy it will make Grandison to have a friendly letter from\\r\\nRichard!” she thought, recognizing the handwriting, and she sat\\r\\nwondering if, after all the letters they had written to him and the\\r\\npostcards they had sent, he still remained cold and unforgiving.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He loved Grandison; he cared for nobody else, and yet Grandison never\\r\\ngave him any happiness and never showed him any consideration. I\\r\\ncannot bear to think of his feelings after they parted in anger on my\\r\\naccount. But this letter must be to say that he has become reconciled\\r\\nto the marriage; he would not write otherwise.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard had sent a wedding present, but when they had gone to the\\r\\nstudio they found it locked, and after the third or fourth fruitless\\r\\nvisit the _concierge_ had told them that he had gone away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne looked again at the letter, and saw that it bore an English stamp\\r\\nand that the postmark was Dry Coulter; Richard must have gone home\\r\\nsuddenly on a surprise visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is strange how real Dry Coulter is to me! I was unhappy while I\\r\\nwas living there, yet all my memories of it are beautiful, and nowhere\\r\\nelse in the world seems so real as that village. Are the English elms\\r\\nmore beautiful than the olives? Is the song of the blackbird as lovely\\r\\nas Fleury’s flute? Why do I remember every detail of my life before my\\r\\nmarriage and nothing of the things that happen to me now? Nothing is\\r\\nreal to me now but Grandison, my happiness in him is such that I can\\r\\nenjoy no other beauty.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Anne reminded herself how she had been with him to the opera and\\r\\nto students’ balls in Paris night after night, but the memory of them\\r\\nwas already dim, a lovely voice thrilling her for a moment, a sea of\\r\\nlights, a crowd of faces.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot keep my attention fixed on the stage,” she said to herself.\\r\\n“At every moment I have to turn to glance at him, to look at his blunt\\r\\nhealthy features, his soft and furry hair, his round head, so like a\\r\\nseal’s or an otter’s thrust suddenly above the surface of the water.\\r\\nAll I remember of the opera, of the picture galleries, and of the\\r\\ncastles which we saw yesterday, is catching Grandison’s eye to see\\r\\nwhether he were moved by the same things that moved me--and because of\\r\\nthat I felt no emotion except about him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed, but her happiness was coloured with the regret that her\\r\\nonly opportunity of seeing so many beautiful things should have been\\r\\nduring her honeymoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We should have been just as happy if we had stayed in that horrid room\\r\\nwith the beautiful view.” And Anne recalled how they had spent their\\r\\nfirst days held in a web of unrealities, making declarations, mumbling\\r\\naffidavits before a consul, handing telegrams through wire netting, and\\r\\npatiently waiting for permission to get married. “Days vague and as\\r\\nimpossible to remember as the waving of weeds seen through water,” she\\r\\nsaid. But Sir John, who had cut off his son’s allowance while he was\\r\\nliving in Paris with Richard Sotheby, had been pleased at the marriage\\r\\nand had sent a cable with his blessing and a thousand pounds from\\r\\nCeylon.... And dismissing the past, Anne paused for a moment to wonder\\r\\nwhat their life would be like in the future. Grandison had consented to\\r\\nlive in London and to take the job his father had offered him in the\\r\\ntea business.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How long he is, dressing!” she exclaimed, and jumping up she ran up\\r\\nthe yellow stairs to their bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had forgotten to take Richard’s letter with her, but it was the\\r\\nfirst thing she spoke of.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve been using my powder puff,” she added, for his shaven cheek was\\r\\ndelicious with scent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stingy! Stingy! If there is anything I hate it’s stinginess!” he\\r\\nexclaimed, embracing her again. She fought with him but was overcome;\\r\\nthey laughed, but their laughter changed suddenly to the seriousness of\\r\\nlove-making.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a devil you are, Anne, slipping out of bed like a mouse without\\r\\nwaking me until the moment you were going down to breakfast.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is difficult to wake you,” she answered. “And I always feel a\\r\\ncriminal when I do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a sly hypocrite. But I vowed I would not come downstairs this\\r\\nmorning until you had come up again to find me. You see your tricks\\r\\ndon’t work.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“For all you know I might have gone out with the American ladies.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should have stayed here all day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are scandal enough as it is in this hotel,” she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just as we were at Dijon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you will go down alone to breakfast, naturally you cause a scandal.\\r\\nPeople think something dreadful must have happened. They see that you\\r\\ncare nothing for me, Anne. Love means nothing to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer looks were a sufficient answer to his reproaches, and he was silent\\r\\nas she seized him and bent over him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Keep still,” she whispered. Looking up, Grandison could see the\\r\\nceiling of the darkened room striped with bars of light from the\\r\\nupturned slats of the shutters. Outside, the sunlight poured into the\\r\\ngrilling street; an electric tram passed by, its passage announced\\r\\nby the swishing of overhead wires and followed by the crackling of\\r\\nelectric sparks. Wrapped in the weakness of love, Anne and Grandison\\r\\nlay at each other’s mercy; each tiny movement was agony to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Keep still! Keep still!” A cry broke from their lips, and then, in\\r\\nthe solitude of perfect unity, they fell asleep. The overhead wires\\r\\nswished, an electric tram lurched past the hotel on grinding wheels,\\r\\nabove which the soft crackle of electricity came like the sound of a\\r\\nsilk skirt. Already the American ladies had left the hotel, the waiter\\r\\nin the courtyard had cleared away the cold coffee and the uneaten\\r\\nrolls; the forgotten letter had been handed in at the manager’s office;\\r\\nthe chambermaid had looked through the keyhole and had gone away to\\r\\nwash vegetables in the kitchen, before either husband or wife spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What time is the bus?” he asked, girding his silk trowsers with a sash.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In five minutes!” screamed Anne, looking at the gold wrist watch that\\r\\nRichard Sotheby had given her. Grandison seized his pocket-book and\\r\\ncigarettes, they snatched up their Panama hats and fled down the cool\\r\\nstaircase with its smell of varnish and of glue, out into the baking\\r\\nheat of the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no taxi to be seen and no tram.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Run!” he cried, and they ran, though the air came hot to the mouth and\\r\\nthe sun slashed through their silk shirts, scorching their shoulders.\\r\\nThey were late, but the char-a-banc had waited for them, and when\\r\\nGrandison had cried out: “No breakfast!” it waited while he rushed into\\r\\nthe station buffet and came back with a bottle of sweet champagne,\\r\\na long roll of bread and a green water-melon. They sat in the front\\r\\nseats, and the oilcloth cushions ran with their clean sweat, while they\\r\\nwere drinking champagne out of the palms of their hands and spilling it\\r\\nover their knees as the heavy car lurched and bumped on the road. They\\r\\nlaughed, and the melon juice ran over their chins and into their ears;\\r\\nthey spoke their thoughts aloud heedless of the American ladies and the\\r\\nparty of English school-teachers behind them, and the whole char-a-banc\\r\\nof twenty people was united by the happiness of watching them. Looking\\r\\nat the outlines of their shoulders, everyone was moved to a gay,\\r\\nslightly tipsy sentimentality; the discomfort of a whole day’s jolting,\\r\\nof being a school-teacher and wearing stays, or a double-breasted\\r\\nwaistcoat and starched collars and side-whiskers, all such ills\\r\\npassed unnoticed. As for the lovers, they paid no attention to their\\r\\ncompanions and scarcely even looked at the sights they had come to see.\\r\\nStrolling through the Roman theatre and the bull-ring at Arles, they\\r\\nmade silly jokes about asparagus, and on the way home broke into their\\r\\nfirst quarrel, Anne maintaining that a cigale was a grasshopper, while\\r\\nGrandison reiterated that it was a sedentary dragonfly with a beetle’s\\r\\nbody.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A letter for you, Sir,” said the porter as they entered the hotel, and\\r\\nthey looked at each other in embarrassment, wondering how they could\\r\\nhave come to forget Richard’s letter. A word from him meant so much\\r\\nto both of them! But recollecting how it was that they had so nearly\\r\\nmissed the bus that morning, they broke out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bad news,” said Grandison, his face changing suddenly. “Richard’s\\r\\nfather, the grocer, has gone bankrupt. The worst is that I cannot help\\r\\nfeeling I have had my share in causing it by my cursed extravagance.\\r\\nRichard paid for everything for me, and for Ginette.” As he said this\\r\\nhis face flushed scarlet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is more likely to be the hotel,” said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, that is what Richard says, and then there is a message about your\\r\\nfather,” he added, handing her the letter. His face was still flushed,\\r\\nbut the first feeling of shame had passed into one of anger with the\\r\\noutside world that threatened to break in upon his happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                            Dry Coulter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Dear Seal,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Why do you and Anne send me so many postcards? I ask because I got\\r\\n  six yesterday; very disturbing when I am doing my best to forget you.\\r\\n  “Let the dead bury their dead.” What does that mean? Perhaps I have\\r\\n  got the phrase wrong, but for some reason though I don’t understand\\r\\n  what it means I find it expresses my feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n  So don’t send me any more postcards. I shall think of you and Anne\\r\\n  quite as much as you deserve, and I shall want to see you directly\\r\\n  you come back to England.\\r\\n\\r\\n  You ask me what I think of your compact with your father, and your\\r\\n  giving up painting. I have no opinion about it: you must settle your\\r\\n  own affairs as you think best. If you mean: do I think you would have\\r\\n  been a good painter if you went on, I don’t. But I think you might\\r\\n  have eventually done something else, I mean something serious, and\\r\\n  badly as I think of you I still believe you capable of something\\r\\n  better than being a tea-merchant in Mincing Lane. That seems to me a\\r\\n  frivolous waste of time. One only has one life.\\r\\n\\r\\n  I have plenty to distract me here: my father has involved himself\\r\\n  in a tiresome disaster. He has gone bankrupt with no assets but an\\r\\n  unfinished hotel with water-logged foundations, which would have\\r\\n  flooded every winter. He has taken to his bed with a bad heart\\r\\n  attack, and I have spent a hectic fortnight finding out the exact\\r\\n  position. Meanwhile I have arranged for a show in Bond Street, and\\r\\n  have got a commission to paint a portrait. I am setting up in London.\\r\\n  The only drawback is that England always gives me indigestion. My\\r\\n  mother is quite unmoved by the bankruptcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Please tell Anne that I haven’t seen her father, but from what I can\\r\\n  hear his position is much more serious. He has given up taking the\\r\\n  services in church, and people think that he is definitely odd. The\\r\\n  vicarage certainly looks odd; he wouldn’t open the door to me. I\\r\\n  think Anne ought to come down as soon as possible. I will do what I\\r\\n  can but I have got my hands full just now.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rachel sends her love; she is a pretty creature. I shall have to\\r\\n  begin to think about sending her to Newnham in a year or two. There:\\r\\n  I know you can’t help your character (a bad one) any more than I can\\r\\n  help mine, so don’t let’s think of our characters and don’t send me\\r\\n  any more postcards or letters.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                      Au Revoir,\\r\\n                                                                RICHARD.\\r\\n\\r\\n  P.S. Ginette has got the job she meant for Anne, as a mannequin\\r\\n  _style anglais_. She writes to me _every day_. Whose fault is that?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne crumpled the letter in her hand; she did not feel shame or anger\\r\\nas her husband had done; she had no irritation against the outside\\r\\nworld but only pity. As she followed her husband to the stairs her\\r\\nmind was busy with plans for returning to England. She thought of her\\r\\nfather, of the old grocer lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and of\\r\\nMrs. Sotheby.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All the same, we were right to send Richard all those postcards; he\\r\\nwould have been more unhappy without any news of us.” Grandison was\\r\\nstamping about the room in a rage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It means no more to me than a famine in China,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We had better pack our things; we shall have to go home to-morrow,”\\r\\nanswered Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the train the outside world became once more “like the waving of\\r\\nweeds seen through water,” a series of noises, smells, and movements\\r\\nwhich concerned them little, and they did not speak of the future until\\r\\nthey were on the boat, when Anne said: “Let’s deal with our affairs\\r\\nseparately: while you are arranging with your father’s firm I will go\\r\\ndown to Dry Coulter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison nodded, and realizing that the cliffs before him were indeed\\r\\nthose of Dover, that an interview with his uncle and his elder brother\\r\\nawaited him, and that his father would be back in England in a few\\r\\ndays, a bitter regret seized him that he had ever seen Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Love for this woman is ruining my life,” he said to himself, but when\\r\\nhe turned his head and he found himself gazing into her pale, fierce,\\r\\nhappy face, he understood that he was helpless. He looked at his wife’s\\r\\nshort straw-coloured hair, her intense grey eyes and her slim body, and\\r\\nlistening to her abrupt speech he told himself that everything else was\\r\\nunimportant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am glad I didn’t buy a bicycle,” said Anne. She had been thinking\\r\\nfor a moment of the past.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSIXTEEN: ANGELS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train reached Linton station at last, and Anne leaped out of the\\r\\nstuffy carriage, all the weariness of her long wait at Cambridge\\r\\nforgotten in the excitement of seeing again what she had so often seen\\r\\nbefore. She could not hide the eagerness in her voice as she handed her\\r\\nbag to the porter, asking him to give it to the carrier.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Miss, are you glad to be back?” he asked, recognizing her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, of course I am,” she answered, and smiling with surprise she made\\r\\nher way across the market place.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinton was unchanged, and she was filled with joy and gratitude to the\\r\\nlittle town, believing that it could never alter in the future and not\\r\\nreflecting that it was scarcely three months since she had set off with\\r\\neven greater excitement on her way to France in the belief that she\\r\\nwould never see Linton again.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe walked on, and turned down Bridge Street, rejoicing to see the\\r\\nsigns over the shops and the faces of the shopmen who were standing in\\r\\ntheir doorways looking out for the last customers before closing--all\\r\\nfamiliar things and persons. On the crest of the bridge she paused and\\r\\nlooked back, thinking that on the morrow she would have met Grandison\\r\\nat the station and would be walking with him through the streets of\\r\\nthe old town. A lorry coming towards her filled the bridge, and she\\r\\ntook shelter in one of the angles of the parapet. Looking down over the\\r\\nside, she watched the waters of the Ouse slipping away from the masonry\\r\\nof the piers, and hoped that she would see a fish, but no fish showed\\r\\nitself, and when she lifted her eyes she was startled by the sight of\\r\\nan addition to the landscape, the beginnings, surely, of Mr. Sotheby’s\\r\\nhotel. There was a huge hole excavated by the edge of the river, filled\\r\\nwith muddy water, a mound of blue clay, an ordered pile of white glazed\\r\\nbricks, a few wheelbarrows upside down, a lot of drain-pipes and\\r\\nnothing else.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So perish all innovations!” Anne exclaimed, and recollecting how\\r\\nthe old grocer had talked to her three months before, and seeing his\\r\\ntragedy before her, she began to laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wonder if Richard laughed when he saw that hole full of water? Yes,\\r\\nto be sure he did, for we all laugh at our parents, we understand them\\r\\nso well,” but, her thoughts turning suddenly to her own father, she\\r\\nsighed in despair and walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had scarcely left the bridge when she caught sight of the grocer\\r\\nhimself. He was sitting bolt upright, driving his flea-bitten white\\r\\npony, his head thrown back, and his white beard sticking out in front\\r\\nof him. “Like a billy-goat looking up to Heaven,” thought Anne. “Yet he\\r\\nis like Richard too, he has the same foxy nose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good evening, Mr. Sotheby,” she called out. The pony had dropped to\\r\\na walk as she spoke, but the old man’s eye fell stonily on her and he\\r\\nmade no answer to her greeting. When he had passed, Anne looked after\\r\\nhim in doubt whether she had been deliberately ignored or had not\\r\\nbeen recognized, or perhaps not even heard, and she saw that the old\\r\\ndog-cart had been lately repainted and newly varnished; on the back was\\r\\nwritten in scarlet letters:\\r\\n\\r\\n  “INTERNATIONAL TEA TRUST.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He looks ill,” she thought. “And his illness is that his pride has\\r\\nbeen wounded. He has been so virtuous and so successful all his life,\\r\\nit is too bad that Grandison and Ginette, and excavating a hole in a\\r\\nriver bank, should have combined to ruin him.” She smiled as she said\\r\\nthis, but her thought was broken suddenly by the reflection that her\\r\\nown father was waiting for her and that in less than an hour they would\\r\\nbe speaking together. Trouble would be sure to arise between them at\\r\\nonce, and each of them would behave with falsity. And reluctant to come\\r\\nto her journey’s end, unconsciously she dropped into a slower walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road was long and dusty, and she was glad to turn aside into the\\r\\nfootpath by the cross-roads, a footpath that was little frequented,\\r\\nfor it was half a mile longer than the road. The first field was so\\r\\nhuge that it seemed she would never cross it; there was not a tree on\\r\\nwhich she could rest her eyes and nothing in it except the tussocky\\r\\ngrass underfoot and a dozen thirsty bullocks clustering round an empty\\r\\ncistern by the gate, waiting for the water-cart. A field of ripening\\r\\nwheat lay next, and she pushed her way down the narrow lane between\\r\\nthe ears, unable to resist snatching at some of them. The grains were\\r\\nstill full of milk, yet there was something dry even in their juiciness\\r\\nwhich made her clear her throat and wish for a cup of tea. Already she\\r\\ncould see the elms of Dry Coulter, and she pushed on, getting at last\\r\\ninto the next field, where there were men at work with teams of horses\\r\\nharrowing and rolling the dusty earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is likely enough that these are the men and the horses that came\\r\\nto our doorstep in the snow,” she said, and soon she had crossed to the\\r\\nfar side, where a line of men, bent up double, were strung out across\\r\\nthe field. But so big was the expanse that rollers and harrows, men and\\r\\nteams of horses and this string of men dibbling, were so far away that\\r\\nshe could not see their faces, and felt as though she were alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are planting cabbages,” she guessed. “Each man leans forward\\r\\nto make a hole with the dibber in his right hand, sticks in a young\\r\\nplant and treads it firm with his left heel as he passes in his stride\\r\\nforward to strike the next hole. So they work all day, and this will be\\r\\na vast expanse of cabbages before the winter. The life of these men is\\r\\nto labour all day in the sun, or in the rain, in these immense fields,\\r\\nalone for hour after hour, with nothing to speak with but horse, and\\r\\nto go back at night to sleep in a tiny room with a candle burning in\\r\\nthe closed window, then to rise again with the first colour of the\\r\\ndawn. That is the life that the greater number have always led, yet it\\r\\nhas hardly touched our thoughts and we live on their labour, drinking\\r\\nthe milk and swallowing the buttered toast, thinking of anything\\r\\nrather than of how the cows are kept fat and the thistles and docks\\r\\nare spudded out to make room for the wheat, for there is nothing in\\r\\nall that labour, or in all those lives, to interest us. The labourers\\r\\nthemselves are silent about it; there are few songs which take mangels\\r\\nor potatoes as their subject, and when we look for poetry in the fields\\r\\nwe turn south to Italy or Greece and the goats nibbling at the vines.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe footpath had been ploughed up, its last traces had disappeared\\r\\nbeneath the harrow and the roller, and she walked carefully among the\\r\\nyoung cabbage plants, withering and grey after the long day’s sun. They\\r\\nlooked dead, but they would live.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They would die in a garden unless they were shaded under flower-pots,\\r\\nbut everything lives in the fields; perhaps the air is purer under the\\r\\nopen sky,” thought Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she crossed into the next field a bird flew out of a poplar tree by\\r\\nthe stream. “A hawk,” was her first thought, but it surprised her by\\r\\ncalling “Cuckoo” as it flew.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He ought to have changed his tune a month ago. ‘In July he gets ready\\r\\nto fly; in August, go he must.’ Go he must, go he must,” she repeated,\\r\\nand the sentence in her father’s letter came back into her mind in\\r\\nwhich he had compared her to a whitethroat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed he was right, for I was under the same compulsion to go as\\r\\nthe birds, but my going was harder. At least I fancy so, though the\\r\\nyoung swallows find it a difficult business to leave England, staying a\\r\\nweek or two after the old birds have gone.” And Anne was surprised at\\r\\nherself for thinking of the birds with pleasure: in the past she had\\r\\nfound her father’s love for them so irritating.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I remember that I wished for a bird for my hat, yet in Paris where\\r\\nI could have worn it, the suggestion would have disgusted me. There,\\r\\nwhere I was going to the opera, I was always thinking of the birds, and\\r\\nthe one beautiful thing that I shall never forget is the shout of the\\r\\nbirds’ song with which one is woken on a March morning. And how they\\r\\nsing after the rain.” She laughed at the contradiction in herself which\\r\\nhad made her love in Paris what had so much bored her in England.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yet within an hour of my meeting with my father I shall be wishing the\\r\\ncats good hunting,” she added smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How will he greet me, I wonder?”--a question which had been repeated\\r\\nso often that it made her ill with apprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are the troubles that await me?” She was already at Dry Coulter;\\r\\nthe elms rose up before her, and when she had crossed the last field\\r\\nthe path would lead her through the churchyard and on to the green. The\\r\\nlast field had been cut and the last of the hay was being carried, a\\r\\nlittle boy drove a clicking horse-rake across her path and, pulling a\\r\\nlever, dropped a thin roll of the last gleanings of hay at her feet;\\r\\nfarther on two women were raking up the wisps of hay into heaps and a\\r\\nboy was pitching it into a red tumbril where another boy gathered it\\r\\ninto his arms and trod it underfoot, after which the old mare was led\\r\\non to the next heap.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne could see that the hard work was done, that they were enjoying\\r\\nthemselves playing at hay-making, clearing up what the men had left\\r\\nbehind. Soon she was out of the hay-field, slipping over the wall of\\r\\nthe churchyard, a wall which had been worn smooth by the breeches of\\r\\ngenerations of labourers, for a short cut to the footpath ran among the\\r\\ngraves beneath the limbs of the giant sycamore. She had never liked\\r\\nthe tree, sharing her father’s jealousy for the little church so far\\r\\novertopped by it and so overshadowed in summer. If it had not been part\\r\\nof the rookery he would have had it cut down. The nests were hidden now\\r\\nin the leaves, and as she looked up into the tree an old fancy came\\r\\nback into her mind and she said: “The sycamore is like Ely Cathedral,\\r\\nso cool and so airy; to hop from one branch to another must be like\\r\\nsitting first on one chair and then on another; the pigeons shorten\\r\\nwing and alight to rest a while before they continue their voyages,\\r\\njust as the tourists come in and sit for a few moments before they\\r\\nmotor on to Cambridge or King’s Lynn.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she passed the porch she stopped with a new curiosity to read the\\r\\nnotices, in the past she had so often written them herself, but the\\r\\nnotice which caught her eye brought back all her apprehensions:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTICE\\r\\n\\r\\n  Owing to the continued indisposition of the vicar, arrangements have\\r\\n  been made for morning service to be held every Sunday by the Reverend\\r\\n  J. Grasstalk and the Reverend the Honourable F. H. G. L. à Court\\r\\n  Delariver, alternately, until further notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                          F. LAMBERT  }\\r\\n                                          H. BOTTLE   } _Churchwardens_.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That means that father will lose his living unless I can persuade\\r\\nhim.... I shall have to write to the Bishop. Perhaps if he took a\\r\\nholiday....” Anne hurried on and her spirits rose, for the worst had\\r\\nnot happened. She had feared that she would find an inhibition. She\\r\\nopened the lychgate and went out on to the green, passing beneath the\\r\\nelms. There was the little stream, and there lay the old monument and\\r\\nthe maze, but her thoughts of her father were dispersed by catching\\r\\nsight of a jumble of yellow derricks, of caravans and steam engines on\\r\\nthe green.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dry Coulter feast!” she exclaimed in astonishment. “Why, it must begin\\r\\nto-morrow! Here are the swing-boats and the roundabouts; here are the\\r\\nshowmen and the gipsies.” She hurried forward, excited and yet annoyed\\r\\nthat her home-coming had chanced to be on the eve of so momentous an\\r\\noccasion as the village feast. “Timed to fall between the hay-making\\r\\nand the harvest,” she said to herself. “Richard would tell me that the\\r\\nfeast is as much a pagan custom as Plough Monday or May-day. Each of\\r\\nthe villages about here has its feast, and they come one after another\\r\\nin the height of summer. They are feasts at which there is little\\r\\nfeasting, only a roundabout and swing-boats on the green, but to-morrow\\r\\nthe village girls will dance and the men roll up their shirtsleeves and\\r\\ntry their strength and run in hurdle races, or win coconuts or a cup\\r\\nand saucer.”\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the elms and the beeches the canvas booths were already\\r\\nstanding, five or six men were working hard to put up the swings, women\\r\\nwere carrying pails of water, and the horses, still in their harness,\\r\\nwere roaming over the green and cropping the grass. All the travelling\\r\\npeople and even their children were working hard; they shouted to each\\r\\nother as they ran to and fro without sparing a glance for the groups of\\r\\nvillage children, the boys following them and getting in their way, the\\r\\ngirls standing and gazing, or sitting close by in the grass. Among one\\r\\nof the groups, sitting and lying on the grass, Anne recognized a friend\\r\\nas she drew nearer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rachel,” she called, and the little girl looked up at once, but she\\r\\nhesitated for a moment before rising to her feet and, though she came\\r\\nto meet her, Anne noticed that she walked slowly where a few months\\r\\nbefore she would have run. The child’s shyness caused a like shyness\\r\\nin Anne herself, and they stood facing each other without kissing or\\r\\nshaking hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you very much for the postcards you sent me, Mrs. Grandison,”\\r\\nsaid Rachel. “Richard gave me all the postcards you and Mr. Grandison\\r\\nsent him and I have put them all in my album.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish you could have seen some of the places we went to, Rachel. A\\r\\ngreat river, the Rhone, rushes down between the vineyards, and there\\r\\nare castles and wonderful old towns,” said Anne, and for a little while\\r\\nshe chattered of what she had seen abroad, but ended by saying: “I see\\r\\nthey are getting ready for the feast. We went to a wonderful circus at\\r\\nAvignon. I thought of you, Rachel, when I saw it. Grandison won a live\\r\\npigeon as a prize, for which we had no home, so we let it fly from the\\r\\nbridge over the river. It beat its wings and flew crazily this way and\\r\\nthat, but at last it lifted itself and disappeared over the battlements\\r\\ninto the town. Have you been to any circuses since we went to Linton\\r\\nFair together?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a look of defiance in the child’s face and a hard note in her\\r\\nshrill voice. Her face was paler than ever, but dark under the eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I haven’t been to a circus there, Mrs. Grandison. Richard wanted\\r\\nto take me to the feast at Wet Coulter but I wouldn’t go.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll enjoy the feast here to-morrow, won’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I shall enjoy the Dry Coulter feast, Mrs. Grandison,” answered\\r\\nRachel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come part of the way home with me,” said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll come to the edge of the green.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked for a little while in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have had your hair cut, Rachel. Was that Richard’s doing?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girl blushed scarlet, she hung her head and seemed on the\\r\\npoint of bursting into tears. Anne cursed herself for her unfortunate\\r\\nquestion. “The child must have got creatures in her head; I should have\\r\\nremembered the village better,” but she was mistaken in her thought,\\r\\nfor when Rachel spoke it was to say: “I heard that you had your hair\\r\\ncut off, Mrs. Grandison.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne took off her hat. “Yes,” she said. “It is shorter than yours. Did\\r\\nRichard tell you that?” Their eyes met; Rachel had recovered herself.\\r\\n“I am going to let it grow again,” she said defiantly. “Father doesn’t\\r\\nlike it short.” She stopped to kick a stone viciously out of her path.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn hearing Mr. Sotheby spoken of, Anne felt strangely embarrassed, and\\r\\nto turn the conversation she asked: “How is your mother? Will you tell\\r\\nher that I am back and that I shall come round to the shop to see her\\r\\nas soon as I can?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mother is not in the shop now,” replied Rachel almost rudely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had reached the edge of the green, and the little girl stopped\\r\\nshort, motionless and stubborn, by the little bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mother is never in the shop now, nor am I. Father is made the\\r\\nmanager, and there is a man under him learning to take his place.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is Richard here or in London?” Anne asked. “My husband spent a day\\r\\nlooking for him but couldn’t find him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Richard’s busy.” This time the rudeness in the child’s voice was\\r\\nunmistakable, and there was a pause whilst Anne looked down into the\\r\\npale face working with passion. The little girl was trying hard to keep\\r\\nback her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m to go to school at Cambridge. Richard says I am to get a\\r\\nscholarship to go to college.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come a little farther and tell me about it,” said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel’s emotion upset her, and she was tired of standing still.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I must go back now.” The little girl was still uneasy, and shifted\\r\\nfrom foot to foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I daresay we shall meet to-morrow,” said Anne, disappointed. She\\r\\nwas reluctant to let Rachel go, wanting to find an excuse for delaying\\r\\nher own arrival at the vicarage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let’s go to the feast to-morrow and ride on the roundabout together,”\\r\\nshe said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel lifted a pale face and gazed at her angrily; two tears ran\\r\\nunheeded down her cheeks and she answered with indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, you won’t be stopping here long”; then, without waiting for an\\r\\nanswer or to say good-bye, she ran back on to the village green. When\\r\\nshe had gone a little way she dropped into a walk and soon stopped.\\r\\nShe was not in the mood to rejoin her companions; watching the gipsies\\r\\nwould no longer interest her, and as soon as Anne had turned the corner\\r\\nRachel slowly followed in her footsteps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rays of the sun were horizontal, and the last strip of turf by\\r\\nthe Broad Ditch was striped with the shadows of the elms, the darkest\\r\\nand the most brilliant greens; on the water a crowd of ducklings were\\r\\nswimming eagerly in all directions, in and out of the sunlight; in\\r\\nanother half-hour the dew would begin to fall and the little owls would\\r\\ncome out to hoot at the cats. Anne turned to look back. Behind her the\\r\\nlower branches of the elms were already in shadow, their tops shone in\\r\\nthe sunlight; between the trunks she could see a glimpse of the village\\r\\ngreen beyond, with the yellow painted roof of a roundabout. There was a\\r\\nsilence and suddenly Anne gave a long sigh, a sigh of happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am happy now and completely at peace. I was never happy here before,\\r\\nbut I am now, for I am free. The opinion of neighbours cannot weigh\\r\\non me, for my life is full and happy and satisfied. Each day is rich\\r\\nand full, and though summer passes it returns again. There are better\\r\\nyears coming than any of the years which are past, and the leaves will\\r\\nalways drop in November and spring afresh in May.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure of Rachel came into view, and Anne saw the child stop.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, now I must see my father,” she said to herself, shrugging her\\r\\nshoulders, a trick she had caught from Grandison; then she turned\\r\\ntowards the vicarage, and swinging her arms and shaking her bare head,\\r\\nshe walked forward. From a distance the vicarage was black against the\\r\\nsunset, but as she came abreast of it, she saw it clearly, the old\\r\\nfamiliar building, strangely like a Noah’s ark, with a chimney at each\\r\\nend. But the moment that she glanced at it Anne stopped short. The\\r\\nvicarage--it had been burnt! It was a ruin. But the hollyhocks were\\r\\nstanding in full flower; the roses on the wall were not scorched--and\\r\\nAnne could see that there had been no fire: all that had happened was\\r\\nthat the windows had been taken out: there was no glass: there were no\\r\\nwindow-sashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWire netting had been nailed across each of the down-stair windows,\\r\\nbut the bedroom windows were open spaces. Otherwise there was little\\r\\nchange; the front lawn had been mowed recently, the path had been\\r\\nweeded, and round the windowless house all the rose-trees were in\\r\\nbloom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne walked slowly up the pathway, noticing everything and reassured\\r\\nby a hundred little details. The box-trees had been clipped. On the\\r\\ndoorstep she paused, uncertain whether to try the door-handle or to\\r\\nring the bell.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will ring the bell,” she said to herself, lifting her eyes to see if\\r\\nshe were being spied upon from upstairs. Through the open windows first\\r\\none bird flew and then another, a third chased it; then, as the bell\\r\\njangled in the hall, a whole covey of sparrows flew out over her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The windows have been taken out so that the birds may fly in.” The\\r\\nchange seemed to her a sensible one for her father to have made. She\\r\\ncould hear the shuffling of footsteps inside, and at that moment the\\r\\nthought flashed through her mind that if her father’s eccentricities\\r\\nwere become such that he could no longer be a clergyman, he would make\\r\\nan admirable bird-watcher on some island sanctuary.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He would live alone in a hut without seeing anyone for six months of\\r\\nthe year, and he would be perfectly happy.” Her project filled her with\\r\\nexcitement; she longed to talk of it, to find out if she could put it\\r\\ninto execution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door was flung open and her father stood before her, glaring up\\r\\nat her, for the floor of the house was sunk below the level of the\\r\\ngarden, but he showed no sign of recognition. His cheeks were hollow,\\r\\nhis tangled beard full of grey hairs and his black, clerical coat was\\r\\nfilthy with the droppings of birds; the shoulders and sleeves seeming\\r\\nas if they had been spattered over with whitewash. An unpleasant dirty\\r\\nsmell came through the door; in spite of ventilation the house smelled\\r\\nlike an old hen-coop.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne waited for her father to speak, watching him silently while the\\r\\nanger died out of his gaze. He coughed once or twice, blinked his eyes\\r\\nas if very tired, and said at last in a mild voice: “Well, Anne, my\\r\\ndear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you get my letter? I have come to pay you a visit, father.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA mischievous, slightly guilty expression came over Mr. Dunnock’s face\\r\\nand he coughed again. “I am afraid I didn’t read it,” he answered. “I\\r\\nhardly know if I can invite you in. You see I am living with the angels\\r\\nnow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a long silence. “It was very sweet of you to write such a\\r\\nkind letter about my marriage,” said Anne at last. “And to send me\\r\\nMamma’s teapot, and to tell me about the tragedy in the dove house.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The swallows have come back,” said Mr. Dunnock. He spoke eagerly, and\\r\\nstepping out of the house, he took his daughter by the arm and led her\\r\\nround the end of the vicarage. A steel-blue bird circled over their\\r\\nheads and swooped into the open door of the dove house.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Angels,” said Mr. Dunnock, putting a finger to his lips. “They are\\r\\nangels.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE END\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Archaic or variant spelling has been retained.\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GO SHE MUST! ***\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\r\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\""

second Monday in\\r\\nthe year and the Reverend Charles Dunnock drawing back the curtains\\r\\nof his bedroom window said to himself that if the great sycamore full\\r\\nof rooks nests in the churchyard were to fall or even if a steeple\\r\\nwere to be built for the little church of Dry Coulter such changes\\r\\nwould not alter the landscape so much as this snowstorm had done\\r\\nBuried under three inches of snow the country was recognizable but\\r\\nwholly transformed and he asked himself how it was that a uniform\\r\\ncolouring should make a totally new world yet one which was composed of\\r\\nfamiliar objects in their accustomed places\\r\\n\\r\\nIndifferent to the cold he gazed out of his bedroom window enchanted\\r\\nby the beauty of the scene and then as he caught a glimpse of the\\r\\nfirst horizontal beams of the sun falling on Natures weddingcake\\r\\nhe told himself that even the dullest witted of his dissenting\\r\\nparishioners would feel compelled to cry out This is like Heaven I\\r\\ncould fancy myself dead and this Eternity\\r\\n\\r\\nYeshe reflectedall men must feel it for that conceit is helped\\r\\nout by the extraordinary stillness the footfalls of man and bird and\\r\\nbeast are muffled and the world seems empty Nobody is stirring for\\r\\nthere is nothing like a heavy fall of snow to keep people by their\\r\\nfiresides Only the postman and the milkman go their rounds and while\\r\\nhe was dressing he heard their sudden knocks at the back door with no\\r\\nwarning crunch of gravel or sound of the gate slamming in the yard\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir fidelity he said to himself is like that of the clocks\\r\\nstriking the hours when there is death in the housefor Mrs Dunnock\\r\\nhad died exactly a year before and her death was always in his mind\\r\\nHis bedroom had been her bedroom though only for a few months for she\\r\\nhad died soon after her husband had been presented with a living and\\r\\nsince her death he slept alone in the great bed where she had waited so\\r\\noften for him to come up from his study and where he had always found\\r\\nher with her soft hair spread like a birds wing over the pillow and\\r\\nin which she had died\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clocks strike the hours in the moments of our greatest sorrow he\\r\\nsaid to himself Nothing will keep them from the punctual discharge\\r\\nof their duty and listening to them we are recalled to this life\\r\\nwe shoulder our burdens once more we begin ticking again ourselves\\r\\nticking away our ordinary lives\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to the lookingglass hanging over _her_ dressingtable and\\r\\nbegan to comb his beard then looking once more out of the window\\r\\nwatched two men pass by leading a horse along the road to be roughed\\r\\nat the blacksmiths a slow business for one of the men had to throw\\r\\ndown sacks every few yards for it to step on wherever the blizzard had\\r\\nwhirled away the snow and left a polished slide of ice\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a few minutes before nine he sat down to the breakfast table and\\r\\ntook the cup of tea that his daughter poured out for him then hearing\\r\\na shout both Anne and he turned to the window and caught sight of a\\r\\nred muffler flying in the wind and a thrown snowball but when the\\r\\nchildren had passed running on their way to school all was silence\\r\\nfor Mr Dunnock had turned to read a circular which the postman had\\r\\nbrought that morning\\r\\n\\r\\nEvangelicals Evangelicals he muttered angrily for he was a\\r\\nritualist a last flicker of the Oxford Movement had filled his life\\r\\nwith poetry Then he pushed away the newspaper and taking some bread\\r\\nfor the birds he rose from the breakfast table and went to the front\\r\\ndoor\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world outside was dazzling and the snow lay piled up deep before\\r\\nthe sill Mr Dunnock peered out not daring to step in the snow in his\\r\\ncarpet slippers He listened not a sound he looked and marked the\\r\\nroofs which yesterday were but the edges of a row of tiles today as\\r\\nthick as thatchlike Christmas cards And heres a robin he said\\r\\nwaiting for me to throw him some of the bread He threw a piece which\\r\\nwas lost in the snow A weddingcake How strange it is to reflect\\r\\nthat Anne is older now than her mother when I married her Yes the\\r\\nworld is become a weddingcake Something very strange has happened\\r\\nand who knows what will be the end of it for it has begun to snow\\r\\nagain and the rare flakes drift slowly to the ground like feathers\\r\\nfrom the angels wings Are they moulting up there Or has Satan got\\r\\namong them like a black cat which has climbed through the wire netting\\r\\ninto the dove loft\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Dunnock fetched a piece of cardboard from his study to serve as a\\r\\ntable for the birds and dropped it a few feet away on to the snow\\r\\nthen crumbling the bread in his fingers he threw the birds their\\r\\nbreakfast Some of the crumbs fell on each side into the snow and were\\r\\nlost\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they come he said to himself for bright eyes had been watching\\r\\nhim from every tree and bush\\r\\n\\r\\nThe birds fluttered nearer eyeing the crumbs spread out for them and\\r\\nthen looking sideways at the tall bearded man standing in the doorway\\r\\nTheir fear was speedily forgotten for the clergyman made it his habit\\r\\nto feed them every morning and soon the cardboard table was covered\\r\\nwith sparrows robins blackbirds and thrushes all of them flashing\\r\\ntheir wings bickering and scrambling for the finest crumbs like a\\r\\nflock of bantams And having been successful one would often fly off\\r\\nwith a piece in his bill which he wished to devour in solitude\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne Dunnock remained at the breakfast table for she had only just\\r\\nfinished the kipper on her plate The labourers will not go to work\\r\\nin the fields on such a day as this she said to herself And not\\r\\na woman will venture out except me for womens boots are generally\\r\\nleaky and their skirts flap wet against their calves With a frost\\r\\nlike this there should be skating but the snow will have spoilt the\\r\\nice even if it were swept She finished a piece of toast and rose\\r\\nfrom the table to clear away the breakfast The loaf was a pitiful\\r\\nobject only a shell of crust with all of the inside scooped out\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother loaf gone she said to herself We always have stale crusts\\r\\nyet I am sure the birds would eat them as readily as they do the crumb\\r\\nand crusts are so nasty in breadandbutter pudding\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Dunnock continued watching the birds and the draught from the open\\r\\nfront door made his daughter shiver Birds Birds I should like to\\r\\nwear a bird in my hat\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a tall girl beautiful with a small pale face and\\r\\nstrawcoloured hair hair which would not stay up wherever she went\\r\\nshe scattered hairpins She was still in mourning for her mothers\\r\\ndeath and her long black dress fitted her badly hindering her\\r\\nimpatient movements and giving her the look of a converted savage\\r\\ndressed in a missionarys nightgown\\r\\n\\r\\nFather is feeding the birds He never forgets them and here am I\\r\\ngrudging them the crumb of the loaf But housekeeping would have made\\r\\nSaint Francis uncharitable though Saint Francis would not have said he\\r\\nwanted a bird for his hat\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marmalade the cruet the silver toast rack all were put away into\\r\\nthe mahogany sideboard the tablecloth was brushed and holding the\\r\\nlittle wooden tray full of crumbs she went out into the hall where\\r\\nher father still stood at the open door and then leaning over his\\r\\nshoulder she shook the crumbs out on to the snow and scared by her\\r\\nsudden gesture the birds flew off\\r\\n\\r\\nOh Anne how stupid and inconsiderate you are exclaimed her father\\r\\nangrily How little imagination you have Dont you understand that\\r\\nwhen you wave anything suddenly like that you frighten them There was\\r\\nsuch a fine misselthrush too He is not regular and though the other\\r\\nbirds will soon come back he will be discouraged It is most vexing\\r\\nNow that Mr Dunnock had lost his congregation a far larger one than\\r\\nhad ever attended a Communion service at Dry Coulter Church he shut\\r\\nthe door shaking his head irritably then he put his beard in his\\r\\nmouth as if that were the best way to stifle his anger and went into\\r\\nhis study\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book he took up fell from his hands before he had turned the second\\r\\nor third page for he had not the intellect nor the determination to\\r\\nbe a scholar A beautiful word always set his mind chasing a beautiful\\r\\npicture his thoughts clouded over with dreams and he remained lost in\\r\\nmeditation When he came to himself it was to sink on to his knees in\\r\\nprayer for he was a shy man unable to express himself to men and\\r\\nfor that reason much given to communing with God\\r\\n\\r\\nFor twenty years he had been a poor curate at a church in the shadow\\r\\nof Ely Cathedral but he had not been popular he was indifferent to\\r\\nthe things which were important to his fellow clergy and his mystical\\r\\nlove of ritual had found no sympathizers until at last the Bishop took\\r\\npity on him and gave him a small living in a district in the fens His\\r\\ngrowing uncertainty of temper combined with a sort of hopeless oddity\\r\\nhad begun to make him a nuisance and some provision had to be made\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Ely the Church is taken seriously it is a great power and on\\r\\ntaking up his new position Mr Dunnock was shocked to find it\\r\\ncompletely disregarded for the inhabitants of Dry Coulter are\\r\\nNonconformists Even with the few who belonged to the church he was\\r\\nnot a success His sermons were incomprehensible yet they might have\\r\\npassed unnoticed if he had not affected a cassock and a biretta if he\\r\\nhad not placed a crucifix on the Communion table and called a blessing\\r\\non the houses of the sick before he entered them As vicar Mr Dunnock\\r\\nwas a failure and within less than a year he was regarded with far\\r\\ngreater contempt than is usually extended to the clergy Yet he was\\r\\nnot a disappointed man for he had never been ambitious of success\\r\\nand had never imagined that he might be popular He knew that it was\\r\\ntoo late in his life for him to make any effort he was disinclined\\r\\nto exert himself with his parishioners and avoiding them as far as\\r\\nhe could he was not unhappy He had grown lazy too and now that it\\r\\nwas in his power he neglected to hold the innumerable little services\\r\\nwhich as a curate he had longed to celebrate\\r\\n\\r\\nIf his wife had lived he might perhaps have exerted himself but\\r\\nhe knew that Anne did not share his emotions and soon the special\\r\\ndays were passed over and Mr Dunnock remained sunk in melancholy\\r\\nSometimes his conscience pricked him then he shut himself up in his\\r\\nroom and remained for hours in prayer\\r\\n\\r\\nDamn the misselthrush thought his daughter But father is always\\r\\nirritable on Mondays I have noticed it before Life indeed would be\\r\\nintolerable if it were not for the house I have everything to make me\\r\\nunhappy but I love this house Dear old Noahs ark\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went upstairs where Maggie was waiting for her to help in making\\r\\nthe beds Maggie Pattle was a girl of seventeen who lived out with her\\r\\nmother and let herself into the vicarage early every morning for she\\r\\nwas the only servant and came in by the day Shorter than Anne she\\r\\nwas fully twice as broad a wellnourished girl who would eat a pound\\r\\nof sausages or of bacon at a sitting washing it down with vinegar and\\r\\nher red cheeks shone with health\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne often thought that if only Maggie had come from another village\\r\\nshe would have made an excellent servant all her sluttish ways came\\r\\nfrom her mothers being just round the corner she had only to slip\\r\\ndown the vicarage garden and through a hole in the hedge to be at home\\r\\nThe cottage was so small and Mrs Pattle and her family so large that\\r\\nAnne thought of the old woman who lived in a shoe whenever she looked\\r\\nat it though Mrs Pattle never seemed in any doubt what to do She\\r\\nknew when to slap a child and when only to swear at it\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt she was a good mother resembling very much one of the huge\\r\\nsows which sometimes wandered over the village green in front of her\\r\\ncottagea sow whose steps were followed by a sounder of little porkers\\r\\ntrotting about in all directions What if she did chastise one or\\r\\neven gobble it up One would not be missed No indeed for how did\\r\\nit come about that Mrs Pattle had three children that all seemed to\\r\\nbe between two and three years old yet none of them twins Was one\\r\\nof them Maggies Anne thought not but it was difficult to be sure\\r\\nand if the matter were not settled soon she would never know on such\\r\\npoints the Pattles memories were not trustworthy Yes they were a\\r\\nslipshod family though not exactly what one would call an immoral\\r\\none\\r\\n\\r\\nYet though Anne despised Maggie for her sluttishness and\\r\\nuntruthfulness in some ways she admired her Maggie was a good girl\\r\\nshe did what she was told had a passion for washing floors and was\\r\\nnot a bad cook Then she would go anywhere at any time and do anything\\r\\nfor anybody to oblige Mrs Pattles cottage was crawling with babies\\r\\ncould one of them be the fruit of this cheery goodnature\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if Anne admired the way Maggie scrubbed the scullery floor she\\r\\nfelt envy when she saw her sauntering along the lanes with her hands in\\r\\nher pockets whistling like a ploughboy and stopping to speak to every\\r\\nperson she met on the road Did she envy Maggie only because she had so\\r\\nmany friends or was it partly because she knew all the boys and the\\r\\nyoung men and went in the grove in the evenings coming out with her\\r\\ncheeks no redder than they were by nature\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy was it Anne asked herself that she could not whistle as she\\r\\nwalked along in her long black dress and her black straw hat She\\r\\nhad no friends to talk to except the village people and she could\\r\\nonly visit them if they were ill or in trouble That and watching\\r\\nher father feed the birds was not enough to fill her life She read\\r\\nand when the young carters went ploughing she laid aside her book to\\r\\nwatch them as they passed the house sitting sideways on their great\\r\\nhorses Anne liked the way men whistled and their deep voices as\\r\\nthey spoke to the carthorses drinking at the pond voices so full of\\r\\nrestraint and kindliness There was no way for her to speak to these\\r\\nyoung men who looked so cheerful as they went by to work in their rough\\r\\nclothes though sometimes when she was out on a long walk and was far\\r\\nfrom home she had tried to get into conversation with a young farmer\\r\\nleaning over a gate or with a gamekeeper idling along the edge of a\\r\\nwood his black and white spaniel at his heels\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the beds had to be made and since she liked to sleep in a big\\r\\nfourposter that they had found in the vicarage on their arrival and\\r\\nher father also slept in a large bed she helped Maggie to turn the\\r\\nmattresses\\r\\n\\r\\nIt takes two to make a bed properly and with an unselfish companion\\r\\nwho does not take more than her fair share of the sheets to tuck in on\\r\\nher side it is pleasant work\\r\\n\\r\\nHow the mattress bends and coils on itself somersaulting heavily like\\r\\na whale and how brave the great linen sheet looks as you turn it down\\r\\nThe last of the two beds was made and they were tucking in the quilt\\r\\nwhen a strange sound came from outside the housea confused noise of\\r\\nvoices singing Was it a hymn\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever can that be Maggie she asked\\r\\n\\r\\nThats the carters come Miss the girl answered It is Plough\\r\\nMonday today\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is Plough Monday\\r\\n\\r\\nMaggie could only stare at this questionshe could not answer it\\r\\nexcept by saying\\r\\n\\r\\nWell they always keep Plough Monday round here though not properly\\r\\nlike they used to do They came to the gate last year but I told them\\r\\nnot to come singing with your mother lying ill\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall go and see said Anne and she ran across the landing\\r\\nfrom her bedroom which faced the garden into her fathers which\\r\\noverlooked the road\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTWO PLOUGH MONDAY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound of voices came again men and boys singing one out of tune\\r\\nwith the others but all ringing with the same fresh gaiety and purity\\r\\nthrough the frosty air reminding the hearer of the sharp notes of\\r\\nthe blacksmiths hammer raining on the anvil and giving him the same\\r\\nassurance that the very texture of mans ordinary life is a beautiful\\r\\nand joyous fabric\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time Anne could hear the words of the song\\r\\n\\r\\n  One morning very early\\r\\n  The ploughboy he was seen\\r\\n  All hastening to the stable\\r\\n  His horses for to clean\\r\\n\\r\\nShe ran to the window and looking out into the whiteness she was\\r\\nblinded for the first moment by the sun shining on to the dazzling\\r\\nfield of snow but in the next instant she perceived three great\\r\\nchestnut horses standing just below her immediately in front of the\\r\\ndoor They were harnessed to a plough at the handles of which stood a\\r\\nlabourer whilst at the head of each of the horses was a young carter\\r\\nand on the foremost of the horses were two little boys riding It was\\r\\nthe voices of these little boys which were so oddly out of tune\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was astonished to see them with their plough and horses so close\\r\\nto the doorstep and was filled with a sense of strangeness even before\\r\\nshe saw what was most strange about these visitors That a plough\\r\\nshould be standing so close to the house was strange and even for the\\r\\nmoment seemed to her shocking for one of the horses was standing on\\r\\na flowerbed but this was nothing to the appearance of the men for\\r\\nall of them had their faces blacked and their shoulders and their caps\\r\\nwere white with snow The black faces against the whiteness of the snow\\r\\nfrightened her for a moment she caught her breath with fear which\\r\\nturned almost instantly to wonder and delight\\r\\n\\r\\n  With chaff and corn\\r\\n  He did them bait\\r\\n  Their tails and manes\\r\\n  He did comb straight\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was it What was it Something strange something beautiful the\\r\\nthing perhaps she had always wanted and half guessed at but which\\r\\nshe had never before met face to face\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tune changed\\r\\n\\r\\n  Come all you lads and lasses\\r\\n  See a gay ploughboy\\r\\n\\r\\nGay yes they were gay the snow was falling and the sun was shining\\r\\nand they had blacked their faces and come to her doorstep and one\\r\\nblack face with an open pink mouth was looking up at her in the window\\r\\n\\r\\n  Please can you spare a halfpenny\\r\\n  For an old ploughboy\\r\\n  A bit of bread and cheese\\r\\n  Is better than nothing\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was over one of the young carters came to the door and gave\\r\\na knock which echoed through the house Anne started woken from her\\r\\nrapt contemplation of the horses and the men and still repeating under\\r\\nher breath Beautiful they are beautiful she ran downstairs to open\\r\\nthe door Mr Dunnock however was there before her and from the hall\\r\\nshe could see nothing of the men with their black faces nor of the\\r\\nplough nor the horses with their satin coats their manes flecked with\\r\\nsnow and their tails twisted up in plaits of straw her fathers back\\r\\nblocked the doorway and she could hear his voice in anger\\r\\n\\r\\nThats enough of this foolery You should know better than to trample\\r\\ndown the lawn and the flowerbed\\r\\n\\r\\n  Give us a shilling and we shall be glad\\r\\n  Give us a penny and we shall go home\\r\\n\\r\\npiped the two little boys from the horses back Please Sir its\\r\\nPlough Monday we like to keep it up\\r\\n\\r\\nI have nothing for you said her father I have quite enough\\r\\ndeserving objects for my charity He shut the door and found himself\\r\\nface to face with his daughter\\r\\n\\r\\nSome village clodhoppers have come begging said the clergyman\\r\\nthrowing back his head and giving vent to a cough of irritation They\\r\\nactually brought three horses and a plough over the flowerbeds and up\\r\\nto the door\\r\\n\\r\\nThey wont have hurt the flowerbeds father in this weather with so\\r\\nmuch snow on the ground said Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps not he answered but they have made a great mess of the\\r\\nsnow in front of the house besides I had wished to measure the\\r\\nfootprints of the birds\\r\\n\\r\\nYou might have given them something they seemed so jolly\\r\\n\\r\\nJolly Mr Dunnocks cough became almost a bark It is not my\\r\\nidea of jollity nor I should have hoped yours for yokels to black\\r\\ntheir faces in imitation of Christie minstrels and come begging for\\r\\nmoney simply because they are given a days holiday on account of the\\r\\nweather\\r\\n\\r\\nBut father I think that it is an old custom and that they expect to\\r\\nbe given money\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Dunnock gazed at his daughter with real surprise\\r\\n\\r\\nI wont hear of it I most strongly disapprove They may try other\\r\\npeople I am not going to be victimized or imposed on Old custom\\r\\nRemember what the midshipman said in his letter to his mother Manners\\r\\nthey have none and their customs are beastly The clergyman\\r\\nrecovered himself sufficiently to laugh at his own joke but when his\\r\\ndaughter moved towards the door he said angrily I forbid you to\\r\\nencourage them Anne the incident is closed and I have sent them away\\r\\n\\r\\nThe local Christie minstrels however had not gone away and as Mr\\r\\nDunnock spoke a loud knock resounded on the door\\r\\n\\r\\nYou had better go upstairs Anne Kindly leave me to deal with them\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne ran upstairs trembling with rage and rushed into her fathers\\r\\nbedroom where by looking out of window she was able to see what was\\r\\ngoing on and overhear most of what was being said\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr Dunnock opened the door he found all the ploughmen gathered in\\r\\na group on the doorstep\\r\\n\\r\\nIts Plough Monday Sir and we have come to keep it and ask you for\\r\\na piece of money for our song\\r\\n\\r\\nI have told you already to go away said the clergyman coughing with\\r\\nexasperation I dont give money to beggars\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a silence then one of the young men at the back laughed\\r\\nand said He doesnt tumble to it tell the parson that it is Plough\\r\\nMonday\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere would you be if there werent no ploughmen or no ploughing\\r\\ndone asked the spokesman of the group You wouldnt get no tithes if\\r\\nit werent for the plough\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a chorus of approval at that\\r\\n\\r\\nNo that you wouldnt\\r\\n\\r\\nHe cant answer that Fred\\r\\n\\r\\nThey shouted but at the word _tithes_ Mr Dunnock had slammed the\\r\\ndoor in their faces The ploughmen knocked again and for some minutes\\r\\nthe sound echoed through every room in the house Anne could see that\\r\\nthey were puzzled and in some doubt what to do next One or two of\\r\\nthem were laughing another scratched his head while he said Called\\r\\nus beggars did he Reckon we work as hard as he Presently they\\r\\nretreated to one corner of the garden and remained talking together for\\r\\nsome little while until Maggie appeared from round the corner of the\\r\\nkitchen and called out to them\\r\\n\\r\\nYou had best go away she said The parson he says you are a lot\\r\\nof lazy louts I heard him He wont give you naught You wont get\\r\\nnothing if you do plough his doorstep up The ploughmen did not answer\\r\\nher nor did they appear to pay any attention to her words but slowly\\r\\nwent back to their horses heads What must be must be said the\\r\\noldest of the company laying hold of the handles of the plough Ild\\r\\nas lief keep the custom Come on boys he shouted At these words\\r\\nAnne could see that they all suddenly recovered their good humour and\\r\\na moment after they began joking among themselves\\r\\n\\r\\nParson will have to wipe his feet on his mat before we have done with\\r\\nhim said one lad\\r\\n\\r\\nThere wont be anyone shy of paying us our pennies after this added\\r\\nanother\\r\\n\\r\\nLet him preach what sermon he likes next Sunday there wont be no one\\r\\nbut his daughter and our Maggie to hear him swearing\\r\\n\\r\\nHey my beauties shouted the ploughman at the handles\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great horses strained and began to move the young carters at their\\r\\nheads shouted and led the team in a wide circle across the untouched\\r\\nsnowfield which was the lawn the plough sidled and circled through the\\r\\nsnow and the men began arguing with the horses\\r\\n\\r\\nHold back cant you\\r\\n\\r\\nSteady there whoa\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last after one horse had nearly put its head through the window of\\r\\nMr Dunnocks study and another had trampled down a rose bush the\\r\\nplough was got into position at the far corner of the house After\\r\\nthat they all waited while the ploughman left the handles and began to\\r\\nhammer at part of his plough\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fear which Anne had felt when she first looked out returned to her\\r\\nand the sense of strangeness persisted Was she waking or dreaming was\\r\\nshe afraid or was she glad Suddenly she heard Maggies voice saying in\\r\\nexcited tones\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are never going to plough up Mr Dunnocks doorstep and hearing\\r\\nthese words Anne began to tremble\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the ploughman straightened his back and said\\r\\n\\r\\nCalls us idle beggars does he And too busy to speak with us well\\r\\nmark Plough Monday in his prayerbook Get up there\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horses strained and the plough sank through the snow into the\\r\\nsoft earth of a flowerbed the traces tightened and the three horses\\r\\npulled a wrinkle or two showed itself in their haunches and the share\\r\\nof the plough threw up a broad streak of raw earth\\r\\n\\r\\nSteady boys steady by the doorstep called the ploughman and the\\r\\ncarters edged the horses nearer in to the wall of the house In a\\r\\nmoment the plough reached the door and Anne gazing down from above\\r\\nsaw the flagstone lift and topple while the plough ran swiftly on and\\r\\nthe earth streamed out upon the snow\\r\\n\\r\\nI must stop them she whispered but she did not move or take her\\r\\neyes off the scene Watching from above the girl was fascinated\\r\\nand horrified by every detail the swift and irresistible progress\\r\\nof the hidden ploughshare running through the earth delighted her\\r\\nthe strength of the three stalwart Suffolk Punches and the lean\\r\\nsinewy wrists of the ploughman guiding the handles and the gay young\\r\\nmen all thrilled her While watching she could not have told what\\r\\nwere her emotions yet she knew that the scene was beautiful the\\r\\nplough slipping so easily in the rich earth had the grace and lissom\\r\\nstrength of a snake Once again the horses turned sweeping down and\\r\\nhalting beside the hedge of laurel and there was another pause while\\r\\nthe plough was got into position and then the team swept round and\\r\\nstrained forward again to cut the second furrow and that finished to\\r\\ndraw the plough out into the roadway in front of the vicarage while\\r\\nthe ploughman threw the handles on one side and held them down so that\\r\\nthe share skidded through the snow over the grass\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men did not call out nor even appear to speak or to laugh among\\r\\nthemselves having cut their two furrows they went away swiftly\\r\\npausing only for a moment on the road to adjust the ploughshare and\\r\\nthen hurrying on to sing their songs under other windows\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly when the plough had turned the corner of the lane and the last\\r\\nof the horses heads had vanished down the avenue of elm trees did\\r\\nAnne Dunnock leave her position at the window and only then did she\\r\\nburst into a flood of tears I cannot live after such an insult\\r\\nshe said to herself How could they do such a thing to our house But\\r\\nwhy is it that it seemed to me so beautiful as well as so cruel and\\r\\nas she asked herself this question she noticed that though she had\\r\\ndried her tears her hands were still trembling The lawn of virgin\\r\\nsnow has been torn up by the plough the naked earth exposed and the\\r\\ngarden trampled over by the iron shoes of the horses and the hobnails\\r\\nof the labourers she said And our doorstep has been overturned my\\r\\nfathers fault for he was in the wrong I feel now as if I could never\\r\\nforgive him for bringing this shame on us yet if it had not been him\\r\\nit might have been me for the same fault of character is in both of\\r\\nus We are rejected everywhere unable to share in the life around us\\r\\nor to understand it Enid taught me that at Ely but today it has been\\r\\nrecognized by the ploughmen and this broad gash in the earth and the\\r\\nuprooted doorstep proclaim it to our neighbours I shall never dare\\r\\nshow my face in the village after this\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying Anne Dunnock found herself sobbing again This is too\\r\\nsilly she told herself yet the tears continued to flow until she\\r\\ngave up resisting them and lay down on the bed in her own room She\\r\\nthought of Enid to whom she had written so many poems and so many\\r\\npassionate letters only to discover that they had been shown to all\\r\\nthe girls in the school that they had been borrowed and read aloud in\\r\\nevery bathroom where there were girls talking before going to bed I\\r\\ncould have killed Enid she made all the girls in Ely think that I was\\r\\nperfectly ridiculous And all the bitter experiences of her life came\\r\\nback into her mind and were confused with her present unhappiness\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy should we suffer from this she asked herself after a few\\r\\nmoments of weeping For I know father suffers from it as much as I\\r\\ndo though he has never spoken of it to me and perhaps not even to\\r\\nhimself Is it because he is a clergyman or is it because we are in\\r\\nsome way superior cleverer or better than our neighbours No she\\r\\nanswered herself it cannot be that for though I am intelligent\\r\\nperhaps even remarkably intelligent father is terribly stupid In fact\\r\\nhe is almost deficient in some respects and I am sure neither he nor I\\r\\nare superior morally We are both too emotional and too ready to lose\\r\\nour tempers All our troubles spring from the fact that father is a\\r\\nclergyman for whether they recognize it or not ordinary people have\\r\\na contempt for the clergy and clergymen are always ill at ease with\\r\\ntheir fellow men Thank God father isnt one of the hearty sort in\\r\\nhis own way he is an honest man and a religious one but he has ruined\\r\\nmy life It is Ibsens _Ghosts_ over again for Anne had been reading\\r\\nIbsen lately Then a phrase from another book she had been reading De\\r\\nQuinceys _Opiumeater_ came into her mind Unwinding the accursed\\r\\nchain\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can I unwind the accursed chain she asked herself I must begin\\r\\nsoon for I am twentythree and the best part of my life is gone\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is no good crying over spilt milk she said and went on At all\\r\\nevents I am glad that they did not go away when father told them to\\r\\ngo I am glad that they tore up our garden with that narrow snakelike\\r\\nplough wobbling a little as it ran through the earth I am glad of it\\r\\nthough I shall find it hard to face our neighbours after this for they\\r\\nwill have changed Everyone will know of our disgrace\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose from her bed and tidied her hair before the glass as usual\\r\\nall the hairpins had fallen Then turning to the window she looked out\\r\\nover the untouched snowfield at the back of the house where not even a\\r\\ndog had run as yet Everything was covered even the winter jessamine\\r\\non the summerhouse was concealed and the black poplars beyond the\\r\\npond had every twig laden with snow\\r\\n\\r\\nAll will be forgotten as soon as the snows are melted she said to\\r\\nherself suddenly with the certainty that her words were true All my\\r\\nemotion is nonsense To me everything seems changed but it is only\\r\\na joke to the carters they will laugh about it over a pint of beer\\r\\ntoday but in a weeks time they will have forgotten it the fact that\\r\\nsome dog has killed a rat will seem more important My life is not\\r\\nchanged tomorrow the mason will come to lay the doorstep in its old\\r\\nplace and I shall say Its a fine day when I go to the grocers\\r\\nshop and Very seasonable weather when I take the loaves from the\\r\\nbaker That is the nearest that I shall ever get to contact with my\\r\\nfellows why should they care how we live what we do or whether we\\r\\ndisgrace ourselves or not We mean nothing to them\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Anne Dunnock who only a few moments before had been weeping\\r\\nbecause the world was changed began suddenly to weep again because it\\r\\nappeared to her that it had not changed and that it would always remain\\r\\nthe same This time the tears were not so readily checked for one tear\\r\\nbrings the next after it and Anne remained hidden in her bedroom until\\r\\nMaggie knocked at the door to say that lunch was on the table But by\\r\\nthen she herself had forgotten what had so much moved her less than\\r\\ntwo hours before for she had taken up _Peer Gynt_ and as she went\\r\\ndownstairs she was thinking not of the carters with their black faces\\r\\nand the snow on their caps but of the trolls\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHREE SOTHEBYS SHOP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the night the wind changed to the west and rain fell so that by\\r\\nmorning the snow was gone from the grass and only lingered in a few\\r\\nplaces on the roads and on the bare earth of the kitchen garden\\r\\nand the rain which thawed the snow washed away the memory of Plough\\r\\nMonday thus bringing to pass what Anne had fancied sooner than she had\\r\\nexpected\\r\\n\\r\\nShe no longer felt ashamed to go into the village and as for her\\r\\nfather half an hour after the event he had forgotten his irritation in\\r\\nwatching the starlings searching for worms in the loose earth thrown up\\r\\nby the plough\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breakfast old Noah the gardener busied himself in filling in\\r\\nthe furrow and old Simmonds who called himself a builder and fencing\\r\\ncontractor came round and after mixing a little mortar on a board\\r\\nlaid the doorstep back only a trifle askew in its old place\\r\\n\\r\\nTheres your doorstep Miss he said straightening his back as Anne\\r\\nopened the front door and stood on the threshold prepared for walking\\r\\nTheres your doorstep no one will ever shift that again\\r\\n\\r\\nSimmonds was right for Anne lacked the courage to tell him to take it\\r\\nup and set it straight\\r\\n\\r\\nMay I step on it she asked\\r\\n\\r\\nAy hell bear your weight Miss said the old man blinking and to\\r\\nprove his words he stepped on to the doorstep himself blocking her\\r\\npath while he stamped once or twice with his hobnailed boots\\r\\n\\r\\nIs that firm enough for you Miss he asked speaking with melancholy\\r\\npride and then standing aside for her to walk on it herself\\r\\n\\r\\nYes that seems all right Simmonds she said stepping on to the\\r\\nstone and was aware as she spoke that her words were meaningless for\\r\\nwhy should the old man be so proud of the force of gravity which kept\\r\\nthe doorstep where it lay Why should she have to give him credit for\\r\\nit\\r\\n\\r\\nI was going to speak to your father Miss about the sills said\\r\\nSimmonds\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout what\\r\\n\\r\\nIts a long time since they were painted and the wood is perishing I\\r\\nthought perhaps your father might like me to estimate for them\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne frowned the question of the sills annoyed her but she could not\\r\\nescape until she had looked at them\\r\\n\\r\\nSimmonds was rightthe paint on the windowsills had cracked into\\r\\nhundreds of little grey lichenous cups\\r\\n\\r\\nIll speak to him about it she said We must have it done one day\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elm trees were so beautiful it was because of the elms that she\\r\\nloved Dry Coulter Soon the spring would come soon the snowdrops would\\r\\ncluster thickly under the garden walls and every day that passed\\r\\nimproved the quality of the birds song\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no prison so terrible as beauty she said suddenly to\\r\\nherself I love the seasons the beauty of the village the clouds\\r\\nand the tall groves of elms standing round the green I love our\\r\\norchard with its old apple trees and the pears I dream in the winter\\r\\nof what the crop will be in the following autumn fearing that the\\r\\nbullfinches will take the buds or the blossom be cut down by a late\\r\\nfrost yet time is flyingand while my blood runs fast as it does now\\r\\nI must walk demurely like the old woman that I shall so soon become\\r\\nYes I shall be old before I am free to live as I should like Shall\\r\\nI ever go to the opera A cheap seat would doI cannot expect a box\\r\\nor emeralds but one can hear as well from the gallery and it is\\r\\nthe music that I want to hear Shall I escape one day Shall I go to\\r\\nLondon\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it came into her mind that perhaps even if she went to London\\r\\neven if she got to know interesting men and such beings must exist\\r\\neven if she went to the opera with them she might still feel herself\\r\\na prisoner and that perhaps the most that one can do in life is to\\r\\nexchange one sort of beauty for another the beauty of the apple trees\\r\\nfor the beauty of music\\r\\n\\r\\nYes there is no prison so terrible as beauty she said again and\\r\\nadded immediately Now I must go to the grocers and though she\\r\\ndisliked the grocer himself she smiled with pleasure at the thought\\r\\nthat she might see his little daughter Rachel\\r\\n\\r\\n_Emmanuel Sotheby Grocer and Provision Merchant_ was painted over\\r\\nthe little shop with its windows filled with bars of soap packets of\\r\\nstarch clay pipes and walnuts for Sotheby dealt in everything and\\r\\nthough the shop was small the stock was large Sotheby always had\\r\\nwhat you wanted calico mustard cotton China tea boot polish even\\r\\nlamp chimneys There was no shop so good as Sothebys in the nearest\\r\\ntown there was nothing better than Sothebys even in Ely yet would\\r\\nhe be able to provide her with drawingpins It was unlikely almost\\r\\nimpossible and Anne determined not to mention them until she had made\\r\\nher other purchases she would only speak of them just before she left\\r\\nthe shop In that way Mr Sotheby would not feel that she had expected\\r\\ntoo much of him or think that she was disappointed With her hand on\\r\\nthe latch she said to herself I will not speak of the drawingpins\\r\\nif there are other customers but the shop was empty and the jangling\\r\\nbell brought Mrs Sotheby out of an inner room The grocers wife was\\r\\na slender woman of fifty her pale wrinkled face made her seem older\\r\\nthough her hair was still a beautiful brown and when she smiled she\\r\\nshowed two even rows of little pearly teeth Mrs Sotheby was always\\r\\nmerry whenever Anne came into the shop her brown eyes twinkled or\\r\\nshe broke into a low musical laugh while her face crumpled itself up\\r\\ninto all its wrinkles her white teeth flashed and her eyes almost\\r\\nvanished Such a merry laugh greeted Anne that morning and Mrs\\r\\nSotheby explained it by a reference to the events of the day before\\r\\n\\r\\nGood morning Miss Dunnock I have been hearing such dreadful things\\r\\nall yesterday about the ploughmen I am afraid they must have upset\\r\\nyour father but you must not take any notice of them It is all\\r\\nfoolishness and I dont know what the men can have been thinking of\\r\\nbut of course it is an old custom and they like keeping it on that\\r\\naccount You know men are just like boys about anything like that but\\r\\nthey did not mean to be disrespectful or unneighbourly Im sure Your\\r\\nfather is still rather a stranger here I expect he did not understand\\r\\ntheir ways\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Mrs Sothebys words Anne started all her shame came back to her\\r\\nsuddenly but she saw that she must answer A lump came in her throat\\r\\nand her mouth trembled as she said\\r\\n\\r\\nNo neither father nor I had ever heard of Plough Monday It was\\r\\nentirely my fathers fault he is sometimes impatient when he is\\r\\ndisturbed reading\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very foolish of the men said Mrs Sotheby And they should\\r\\nfeel ashamed of themselves but directly I heard of it I knew there was\\r\\na misunderstanding of some sort It happens so easily only I thought\\r\\nI would speak of it because you know it is an old custom and the men\\r\\nare proud of keeping it here so you must make allowances for them\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kindliness of these words was more than Anne could bear Thank\\r\\nyou thank you so much she cried and suddenly she found that her\\r\\ntears would flowshe could not keep them back though she shook her\\r\\nhead angrily and as she did so a couple of hairpins dropped on to the\\r\\nfloor\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment a shadow passed in front of the windows there was the\\r\\nsound of wheels and a horse being pulled up short in front of the shop\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne looked about her wildly but Mrs Sotheby had lifted a flap of the\\r\\ncounter and was saying\\r\\n\\r\\nCome into our parlour and sit down for a little while Miss Dunnock\\r\\nit was foolish of me to speak but I never guessed you would have taken\\r\\nsuch nonsense to heart If one were to pay attention to half the silly\\r\\nthings men do our lives would not be worth living\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne followed Mrs Sotheby through the shop into a little room with\\r\\na coal fire burning in the grate She sat down in the armchair pushed\\r\\nforward for her while the grocers wife hurried back into the shop\\r\\nsummoned by the jangling bell For a little while Anne was overcome\\r\\nwith mortification at finding herself in the grocers parlour and\\r\\nwondered how she could have so disgraced herself\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy if she must cry every morning and it seemed to have become a\\r\\nhabit could she not retire to her own room and weep in solitude\\r\\nBut after a few moments of humiliation the thought came into her mind\\r\\nthat at last she had disgraced herself finally and for ever and this\\r\\nreflection was a consolation to her\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot undo this If I were to steal out of the back door without\\r\\nMrs Sotheby hearing me it would make no difference I have shown her\\r\\nmy feelings I have burst into tears in her shop I cannot pretend to\\r\\nhave any dignity after this\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne dried the last of her tears reflecting that it was exciting\\r\\nto have made a fool of herself and that if she had not lost her\\r\\nselfcontrol she would never have been asked into that parlour Then\\r\\ntaking off her hat she began tidying her hair and looking about her\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room she was in was small and richly furnished with uncomfortable\\r\\narmchairs upholstered in dark red plush there was a table covered\\r\\nwith a red cloth which had a fringe of little balls a slowly\\r\\nticking clock stood on the mantelpiece on a small table before the\\r\\nwindow stood a large green pot containing an arum lily with one leaf\\r\\nhalfunfurled and a white bud showing from the curtain rod hung a wire\\r\\ncage full of maidenhair ferns On the walls were photographs Mr and\\r\\nMrs Sotheby on their wedding day a plump and rather ugly young woman\\r\\nthe Tower Bridge with a ship going through it and a boy with pomatum\\r\\non his hair Then turning her head Anne saw a large photograph\\r\\nhanging just behind her\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a strange face for the young man certainly had a strange face\\r\\nand was wearing an odd little round cap almost like a skullcap with\\r\\na tiny tail sticking up in the middle his throat was bare with no\\r\\nsign of a collar or tie or even of a shirt A cigarette was hanging\\r\\nout of the corner of his mouth but the strangest thing was not the\\r\\ncap but the face or rather the expression of the face for the\\r\\nfeatures themselves were vaguely familiar The young man was laughing\\r\\nbut there was a look of careless contempt almost of insolence which\\r\\nAnne very much disliked The nose was long and straight and rather\\r\\nfoxy the eyes mere slits set wide apart the forehead was broad\\r\\nand large but the chin feeble Good gracious me exclaimed Anne\\r\\nnoticing that in one ear there was a little earring A man wearing\\r\\nan earring How extraordinary She gazed at the photograph for some\\r\\ntime taking in every detail of the face Certainly there was something\\r\\ndisagreeable in the expression the laughter was untrustworthy and\\r\\nheartless he was laughing at other people not sharing his laughter\\r\\nwith them\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the customer was staying a long while in the shop and becoming\\r\\nimpatient she went to the door and listened The voice she heard was\\r\\nthat of Mr Lambert a young farmer whom Anne knew since he attended\\r\\nchurch he was a churchwarden and once he had stopped her in the road\\r\\nand told her that she should go riding\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Anne his remark had seemed ridiculous since he must know well\\r\\nenough that they were too poor to keep a hack for her use and he could\\r\\nnot have meant that he had one for her to ride\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he had wished to say If you get the habit Ill mount you on one\\r\\nof my horses why hadnt he said so He could not have intended that\\r\\nand even if he had what would she have answered What did he expect in\\r\\nreturn That she should go riding with him She smiled at the thought\\r\\nMr Lamberts company might not be so bad but she would not care for\\r\\nit if she were under an obligation to him If she killed his horse in\\r\\ntaking a fence  that would be awkward And if he met a girl whom he\\r\\nliked better as a companion on his ridesin that case she would be\\r\\nleft with the habit on her hands Her father would never allow such a\\r\\nthing think of the gossip there would be\\r\\n\\r\\nDamn this place Damn my father she said to herself and listening\\r\\nto the farmers sharp but very pleasant voice and closing her eyes\\r\\nshe had for a moment the delicious sensation of the horse bounding\\r\\nunder her of patting its withers listening to the creak of the\\r\\nsaddle and keeping her balance while she looked proudly over the level\\r\\nlandscape of the fens\\r\\n\\r\\nI will I will I will she repeated to herself I will ride a\\r\\nhorse once in my life I will even if I get left with a riding habit\\r\\nBut I suppose that is the spirit which brings young girls to ruin\\r\\nI can imagine how Maggie would say to herself I will let my head\\r\\nbe turned by a man even if I am left with a baby Anne laughed at\\r\\nthe comparison Silly thoughts They hurry me on to absurdities\\r\\nand all because Mr Lambert said something polite and meaningless to\\r\\nme for it is politeness to assume that one can do whatever one likes\\r\\nwithout regard for money But here am I laughing when I ought still\\r\\nto be sobbing since I am still waiting for Mrs Sotheby to come and\\r\\nconsole me What shall I do How on earth by what false pretences did\\r\\nI ever get into this cosy little room If Mr Lambert does not go away\\r\\nsoon I shall march into the shop lift the flap in the counter and go\\r\\naway\\r\\n\\r\\nShe listened then to the voices Very good Mrs Sotheby you shall\\r\\nhave the pig for scalding on Thursday unless Mr Sotheby sends me word\\r\\ntomorrow\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bell of the shop tinkled Mr Lambert paused to add a last word\\r\\nand Mrs Sotheby answered him Well if you say so Mr Lambert and\\r\\nAnne could hear her hand on the latch\\r\\n\\r\\nWell I thought Mr Lambert was never going He had come to see Mr\\r\\nSotheby about carting sand and really I didnt know what to say to\\r\\nhim Now I have agreed to share a pig with him let me know if you\\r\\nwould like a leg of pork or sausages or one of my pork cheeses My\\r\\nhusband is so busy now I hardly see him from morning till night he is\\r\\nputting up some cottages at Linton and his mind is far more on them\\r\\nthan on the grocery business so that I have quite as much as I can\\r\\nmanage I am really sorry that I undertook to scald the pig but it\\r\\nwas rather tempting Still however many pigs I scald I shall never\\r\\ndo half so much as Emmanuel does hes out every day of the week and\\r\\ndrives the round himself and then he preaches twice every Sunday\\r\\nhere and in the Ebenezer Tabernacle at Wet Coulter Mr Lambert wanted\\r\\nto see him in a hurry but I could not tell him where to find my\\r\\nhusband I cannot keep in my head half the things he is doing and I\\r\\nhave not yet been out to see the Linton cottages Still it keeps him\\r\\nin good spirits and he is doing it for my boy But I mustnt keep you\\r\\nany longer now Mrs Sotheby stopped speaking she smiled and added\\r\\nrather shyly You will come and chat with me sometimes wont you\\r\\nMiss Dunnock\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne promised to come again soon and spoke of the arum lily beginning\\r\\nto unfold its flower and then passing through into the shop asked\\r\\nfor curry powder and sultanas\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen these had been given her she hesitated asking herself whether\\r\\nafter Mrs Sothebys kindness she could ask for drawingpins Perhaps\\r\\nMr Sotheby would fetch some from Linton but at that moment she felt\\r\\nshy of asking a man who was building a row of cottages to execute her\\r\\nlittle commissions She would wait until another day for that But on\\r\\nthe doorstep she paused\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for being so kind to me I shall always come and talk to you\\r\\nif I am upset by anything\\r\\n\\r\\nThe face behind the counter broke into hundreds of wrinkles the little\\r\\nteeth shone and a delighted laugh answered her Like pouring water\\r\\nout of a glass bottle thought Anne as she went out into the winter\\r\\nsunshine\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was happiness who could doubt it The secret of life was to\\r\\nbe like the Sothebys and to work as they did absorbed in building\\r\\ncottages Would she ever think the prospect of scalding a pig too\\r\\ntempting to be refused if she were overworked already\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Sotheby must be very enterprising she said to herself trying\\r\\nto conquer her dislike for him and forgot the grocer in gazing at the\\r\\ndistant elms which bounded the far side of the village green a quarter\\r\\nof a mile away for in the middle of the village was a long and lovely\\r\\nstretch of common pasture\\r\\n\\r\\nBut who was the boy for whom Mr Sotheby worked so hard And Anne\\r\\nremembered that Maggie Pattle had once told her that the Sothebys had a\\r\\nson Why was it that she had imagined that he was dead But it did not\\r\\noccur to her to connect him with the photograph in the parlour for she\\r\\nwas looking at the elm trees and listening to the song of a thrush\\r\\nthen gazing at the roof of Lamberts barn bathed in sunlight she felt\\r\\nher heart beating happily and asked herself why had she felt beauty\\r\\nwas a prison She could be happy in that village for ever for spring\\r\\nwas coming and the birds were singing\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOUR THE TRAPEZE BOY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA hard frost came early in February\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this lasts said Mr Dunnock eagerly we shall have skating the\\r\\nday after tomorrow but his face clouded quickly and he put down\\r\\nhis cup with a gesture of annoyance The day after tomorrow would be\\r\\nSunday\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may be in for a long spell of frost said Anne but reminded of\\r\\nhis duties her father was not in the mood to be consoled A frost\\r\\nbrings more suffering than you or I can quite realize my dear he\\r\\nsaid severely Think of the poor without the coal or the blankets to\\r\\nkeep them warm think of the seamen in the rigging of ships think of\\r\\nthe outcasts on the roads think of the birds\\r\\n\\r\\nThink of the polar bears said Anne under her breath as her father\\r\\nrose from the table and scooped out the crumb of the loaf\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trap ought to be here in ten minutes I shall be back from Ely\\r\\nby the eight oclock train he said and with these words went to\\r\\nthe front door where an impatient flock of sparrows was waiting his\\r\\narrival\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the trap came she went to the gate and watched her father drive\\r\\naway wondering whether he would meet Enid in the street I am glad I\\r\\nam not going Now the rest of the day is mine Mine and I am free to\\r\\ndo whatever I choose\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road was like iron it rang under the ponys hoofs and Anne\\r\\nthought she had never seen a lovelier morning the spell of the frost\\r\\nwas more beautiful than the enchanted world of the snow had been a\\r\\nmonth before though it was not so strange Every twig was fledged with\\r\\nrime for there had been a fog during the night but already the sun\\r\\nhad broken through the mist the sky was showing blue overhead and the\\r\\nwhite tops of the elms were blushing in the sunshine\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery tree is smothered in snowy blossom it is as if spring had\\r\\ncome and she thought that the flowering time of the cherry in Japan\\r\\ncould not equal the beauty of this February morning in England When\\r\\nshe turned to go back into the house she noticed that the bare wall of\\r\\nthe vicarage was covered with hoarfrost an opalescent bloom shining in\\r\\nthe sunlight\\r\\n\\r\\nA fairy palace fit for the Snow Queen or the Sleeping Beauty she\\r\\nsaid and the words reminded her that Maggie must be waiting for her to\\r\\nmake the beds\\r\\n\\r\\nYou ought to see the fat woman said Maggie Pattle Her bosom was\\r\\nbigger than that pair of marrows Mr Lambert gave for Harvest Festival\\r\\ntheres a paper outside says she is only twenty and weighs nineteen\\r\\nstone I shall never call Ida Whalley fat again after last night\\r\\n\\r\\nLinton Fair lasted two days and the merrygorounds were staying till\\r\\nthe end of the week\\r\\n\\r\\nI went in the swingboats and I went to the circus and I spent seven\\r\\nshillings altogether said Maggie with triumph\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne shuddered at the fat woman but when Maggie spoke of the circus\\r\\nof the little lady who rode on a pink horse and jumped through paper\\r\\nhoops and of a horse that undressed and went to bed and drew up the\\r\\nsheets with its teeth she wished that she could go herself\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy not Why not she wondered Why should I not go this afternoon\\r\\nThere is no disgrace in going to the fair and there are the\\r\\ndrawingpins that I have to buy at Linton I must begin trying to do\\r\\nsome fashion plates Besides I should enjoy the walk on a day like\\r\\nthis\\r\\n\\r\\nThe six miles of road brought a glow of colour into her cheeks and she\\r\\nfelt her heart beat with excitement as she crossed the old bridge over\\r\\nthe Ouse and entered the little town The streets were crowded with\\r\\nmen and beasts the market place was full of farmers and machinery\\r\\nand half a dozen cheapjacks each surrounded by a dense crowd were\\r\\nshouting against each other\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne quickened her pace the noise of a steam organ told her that the\\r\\nmerrygorounds were in a field near the railway station but when she\\r\\nhad passed the first booths the coconut shies the riflerange and\\r\\nthe places where she was invited to win cups and saucers by throwing\\r\\nrings she suddenly became embarrassed Just in front of her were the\\r\\nswingboats sure enough laden with shrieking girls beyond them a\\r\\ngreat merrygoround painted with all the majesty of a heathen temple\\r\\nand loaded with strange idols swans dolphins lions and ostriches\\r\\nturned slowly round like a monstrous hummingtop and near by was the\\r\\nvast curving canvas wall of the circus\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was surrounded by a happy crowd but she could not mingle with it\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready her pink cheeks had drawn upon her the notice of a group of\\r\\nyoung farmers it was clear to her that she could not visit the circus\\r\\nunless she went with a companion At that moment she envied Maggie\\r\\nher freedom as she had never done before Maggie who might laugh or\\r\\nscream until her voice drowned the hurdygurdy and who could answer\\r\\nback when a man spoke to her without anyone thinking the worse\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would be said if she Miss Dunnock the daughter of the vicar\\r\\nof Dry Coulter were to try to win a coconut Many of her fathers\\r\\nparishioners must be in town and with flagging footsteps Anne passed\\r\\nby the entrance to the field full of merrygorounds and walked slowly\\r\\non towards the railway station\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the great tent of the circus she could hear the thumping of the\\r\\nponies hoofs the crack of the circusmasters whip and the falsetto\\r\\nnote of a clowns voice followed by a roar of rustic laughter and\\r\\nclapping hands then passing on she came in view of the showmens\\r\\nencampment a score of caravans with smoking chimneys groups of\\r\\nhobbled ponies and women carrying pails of water hanging out washing\\r\\nand preparing the evening meal\\r\\n\\r\\nA curious life the girl said to herself Wandering from town to\\r\\ntown roaming from one country to another for the circus I see here\\r\\nmay be at Nizhninovgorod next summer and in Italy or Spain six months\\r\\nafter that The women must have a hard life but I would rather be one\\r\\nof them than the wife or daughter of a clergyman If I were to join\\r\\nthem but that cannot besome dark woman would stab me rather than\\r\\nhave me for her daughterinlaw yet if one of these handsome gipsies\\r\\nasked me I would not hesitate to go with him I would rather that my\\r\\nson were a clown or a liontamer than an archdeacon or a bishop\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne roused herself after a few minutes the sun was setting she felt\\r\\nchilly and her thoughts had depressed her My mind runs in a circle\\r\\nshe said Whatever I see whatever I do I come back to the thought\\r\\nthat I am an outcast unable to share in the life around me or to enjoy\\r\\nit and that somehow I must escape from my surroundings for I cannot\\r\\nlive any longer without friends\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned back towards the market place for there is nothing more\\r\\ngloomy than an empty railway station resolving to buy what she needed\\r\\nand then go home without delay\\r\\n\\r\\nLoneliness is terrible and I have not got a friend in the world\\r\\nThe worst fate which can befall a human being is to be born a young\\r\\nlady and meeting the gaze of a handsome gipsy with gold earrings she\\r\\nadded I can see that I do not attract him he does not care for young\\r\\nladies and he is wise We are an unhealthy artificial breed his\\r\\nwomen are better they smell of tallow and wood ashes and have the\\r\\nspirit and the health of mares\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne bought her drawingpins and decided to go home but first she\\r\\nwould have a cup of tea and threading her way past a steam plough with\\r\\nseven shares and through a series of galvanized iron cisterns at\\r\\nwhich a group of farmers were gazing with intellectual doubt written on\\r\\ntheir faces she crossed the market place and went into Whites The\\r\\nturmoil of the fair had not penetrated inside the confectioners shop\\r\\nand she would have thought that they had no knowledge of it there if it\\r\\nwere not that a greater primness reigned and that the very gingerbread\\r\\nseemed weary of the flesh Anne sipped her cup of tea with distaste\\r\\nasking herself what the young ladies behind the counter would have said\\r\\nif she had given way to her desires and they had seen her mounted on\\r\\nan ostrich Did they suffer from such temptations themselves\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had almost finished her cup of tea when the door opened and a\\r\\nlittle girl came in followed by a short thickset whitebearded man\\r\\nof sixty It was Rachel her favourite and her father Mr Sotheby\\r\\nRachel smiled and all Annes depression was laid aside even the tea\\r\\ntasting of wet boots seemed changed by the pleasure of their meeting\\r\\n\\r\\nWell Rachel have you been enjoying yourself at the fair she asked\\r\\nlooking into the pale little face framed in short dark curls The\\r\\nchild nodded her head quickly\\r\\n\\r\\nYes Miss Dunnock thank you very much I have been on the switchback\\r\\nand enjoyed seeing the fair very much Rachels voice was always a\\r\\ntrifle stilted her words always polite and her sentiments always\\r\\nperfectly correct but Anne noticed that on this occasion the childs\\r\\nusual gaiety was lacking A few words with the grocer were sufficient\\r\\nto explain the cause Mr Sotheby had brought Rachel into Linton to see\\r\\nthe fair he had taken her twice on the roundabout but his business\\r\\nwas waiting for him and must be done and since he did not think it\\r\\nsuitable to let the child go to the circus alone he was leaving her at\\r\\nWhites where she would keep warm\\r\\n\\r\\nCome and choose yourself a cake Rachel he said\\r\\n\\r\\nMay I take her to the circus Mr Sotheby asked Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nThere could be no refusal and the two friends set off at once Rachel\\r\\ncarrying the cheesecake she had chosen in her hand\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came to meet Mr Sotheby in the market place the two\\r\\ngirls left the circus and still under the spell of the wonders they\\r\\nhad seen it seemed as if they could never express sufficiently their\\r\\nadmiration and their astonishment The pink horse and the fair rider of\\r\\nwhich Maggie had spoken that morning and the clowns who had appeared\\r\\nso suddenly that one might have thought a shower of frogs had fallen\\r\\ninto the ring after a thunderstorm were discussed in detail but best\\r\\nof all they had liked the handsome young man who had stood on his head\\r\\non a trapeze and who without holding on with his hands had swung\\r\\nrapidly from one side of the great roof of the circus to the other\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Sotheby was driving out of the innyard as they reached the market\\r\\nplace and Anne was about to say goodbye when the grocer offered her\\r\\na seat in his dogcart saying that he would not hear of her walking\\r\\nback alone She was grateful for his offer for she had no great fancy\\r\\nfor the sixmile walk herself and soon they were all ready tucked up\\r\\nin a large rug with nothing to be seen of Rachel crouching against\\r\\ntheir legs but the tassel of her woollen cap Mr Sotheby flicked\\r\\nthe pony with his whip and in a few moments they had crossed the old\\r\\nbridge over the river and had left Linton behind\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the drive home Annes thoughts ran on the young man dressed\\r\\nin scarlet tights like Mephistopheles she could not forget his proud\\r\\nand serious face intent only on his trapeze and indifferent to the\\r\\naudience she would never forget that unsmiling face looking up at the\\r\\ntrapeze above him as he deliberately rubbed first the soles of his\\r\\nshoes and then his hands in a box of sand\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she could not speak of the young man or of the circus to Mr\\r\\nSotheby whom she disliked she could not continue her happy talk with\\r\\nRachel in front of him and they drove in silencea silence broken at\\r\\nlast by the grocer remarking on the number of foreigners that there\\r\\nwere at the fair\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing interests us country folk more than to see a foreigner said\\r\\nhe A black man will draw a crowd anywhere and no wonder either for\\r\\nhowever contented we may be with our own lives we always wish to learn\\r\\nabout those of other people\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is a foreigner of course Anne was saying to herself Perhaps\\r\\nif I went to the circus again tomorrow I might learn his name and\\r\\nwhether he is an Italian or a Spaniard but she roused herself for\\r\\nMr Sotheby was still speaking and then wondering whether his words\\r\\nrequired an answer she looked about her\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risen moon was nearly full there were no stars and the road\\r\\nbefore them sparkled with frost How fast we are driving she\\r\\nreflected There is nothing like a frost to make a pony go and no\\r\\ndoubt he is thinking of his stable The sound of the hoofs rang out\\r\\nthe air was much colder than in the morning so cold that it hurt her\\r\\nto breathe\\r\\n\\r\\nMy son Richard is abroad living in Paris said the grocer and\\r\\nhearing his voice Anne told herself that politeness required her to\\r\\nlisten If she married the trapezist she might live in Paris tooor\\r\\nelse they would travel from town to town wherever there were circuses\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore that boy was eight years old Mr Sotheby went on I knew\\r\\nthat he would have to be a gentleman and I am proud to say that I\\r\\nalways encouraged him to do what he wanted with his life\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would call him Lorenzo What did it matter whether Lorenzo was\\r\\na gentleman or not And Anne said this to herself certain that the\\r\\nboy who had swung so gracefully on the trapeze was a gentleman For\\r\\nwhat is gentility but pride and perfect dignity And he is as proud as\\r\\nLucifer\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone says that I spoil Richard and the old man beside her\\r\\ncracked his whip gaily But as long as I can make money I shall send\\r\\nit to him\\r\\n\\r\\nI am sure you are quite right said Anne Money If only she had a\\r\\nlittle money How that would simplify things\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Sotheby had needed no encouragement and went on speaking All\\r\\nthese farmers hoard their money and laugh at me for spending mine\\r\\nbut I always say that we are both in the right for they havent sons\\r\\nlike my Richard What good is money to my wife and me he asked\\r\\nbut without waiting for a reply continued To him it means books\\r\\neducation painting in the best studios and the company of his equals\\r\\nfor he would not find his equals about here\\r\\n\\r\\nYes money means all that and more thought Anne but aloud she said\\r\\n\\r\\nIs Lorenzo a painter then\\r\\n\\r\\nMy son Richard No he is an artist I am fond of pictures myself so\\r\\nI can understand him I have seen some by the great men Rembrandt\\r\\nTurner and Wouverman There is a fine gallery at Norwich\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very fond of pictures too said Anne I have always wanted to\\r\\ntry oils perhaps I shall one day\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought at first of sending Richard to Cambridge said the grocer\\r\\nfor he was not interested in Annes chances of painting But he said\\r\\nno to it Theres only one place where I can learn to be an artist\\r\\nhe said Paris is the only place for that\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Sotheby shook the reins and murmured to his pony as they crossed\\r\\na little bridge then he continued One hears a great deal about the\\r\\nwickedness of Paris several of our ministers have spoken to me about\\r\\nit but I console myself with thinking that none of those men would\\r\\nmind letting their boys go to sea and there is as much wickedness in\\r\\nHull or Swansea as anywhere on earth\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel shifted her position under the rug and suddenly thrusting her\\r\\nhead out looked about her with curiosity like a little monkey\\r\\n\\r\\nDo the sailors believe in the Pope of Rome father she asked in her\\r\\nprecise voice\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne did not listen to the reply Of course Lorenzo was a Roman\\r\\nCatholic Her father would be heartbroken but she would give up\\r\\neverything for Lorenzo Together they would voyage over the roads of\\r\\nEurope their horses trotting on through the night while the van they\\r\\nwere sleeping in rocked gently on its springs In the early morning\\r\\nshe would wake to find that they were encamped by the side of a\\r\\nstream the curling smoke of the wood fire would be rising beneath an\\r\\nash tree and near at hand the piebald horses would be hobbled and\\r\\nhappily grazing on the dewsoaked grass She would wander along the\\r\\nhedgerow startling a wood pigeon which would rise from the cornfield\\r\\nand catching sight of the black and white of a magpie stealing along\\r\\nthe edge of the wood Soon she would return with her arms full of\\r\\ndogroses and would give one to Lorenzo to wear in his buttonhole and\\r\\nin the evening she would see the fragile flower pinned to his breast as\\r\\nhe swung on the trapeze\\r\\n\\r\\nScripture tells us said Mr Sotheby that children should honour\\r\\ntheir parents but I feel a respect for my son which I never felt for\\r\\nmy father and which I dont expect Richard to feel for me I know\\r\\nthat he works as hard at his painting as I should expect him to work\\r\\nif he had stayed in the shop though of course he earns no money by\\r\\nit Perhaps he never will for the qualities necessary are not the\\r\\nsame and Richard has spoken of men as great as Wouverman living and\\r\\npainting in Paris today who cannot sell their pictures I would\\r\\nrather that Richard were to become a great master than that he were to\\r\\nsell a picture for hundreds of guineas and incur the contempt of such\\r\\nmen Money is not everything one need only read ones Bible to see\\r\\nthat\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pony slackened its speed and turned a corner they were back at\\r\\nDry Coulter\\r\\n\\r\\nSteady boy said the grocer pulling up at the vicarage gate\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you very much Mr Sotheby said Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nA pleasure Miss Dunnock thank you for taking Rachel to the circus\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodnight Mr Sotheby Goodnight Rachel\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodnight Miss Dunnock thank you for your kindness came the\\r\\nchilds voice as the pony darted off impatiently\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a glorious moon Anne said to herself And what a hard frost\\r\\nThere will be skating without a doubt She would have liked to go\\r\\nfor a long walk to straighten out her tangled feelings but it was\\r\\nhalfpast seven it was time to lay the table for dinner\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps Lorenzo is married she said to herself suddenly Then we\\r\\ncan only be friends she added as she opened the door\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFIVE THE FROST HELD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frost held On Sunday morning the little boys lingered round the\\r\\nedges of the Broad Ditch on their way to chapel and Mr Dunnock\\r\\nhurrying to the vestry noticed Mr Lamberts foxhound puppy running\\r\\nacross the ice\\r\\n\\r\\nThere will be skating he said to himself and I have not lived\\r\\nall my life in the fens for nothing I can still show the younger men\\r\\nsomething and he decided to ask Anne to cut sandwiches They would\\r\\nspend the morrow at Bluntishama long walk but one which would\\r\\nrepay them with the finest stretch of ice in Huntingdonshire and at\\r\\nBluntisham Mr Dunnock would see the best figure skaters and be seen by\\r\\nthem\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter evening service he tapped the barometer asking himself if it\\r\\nwould be tempting Providence if he were to look at the skates that\\r\\nevening There might be a screw missing a strap needed or a broken\\r\\nbootlace and such little things were best attended to overnight he\\r\\nreflected trying to conceal his eagerness for he would not be happy\\r\\nuntil he had handled his skates\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will be in the boxroom he said taking a candle with him from\\r\\nthe hall but in the boxroom many things met his eye which reminded\\r\\nhim of his life at Ely It had been a wretched subordinate existence\\r\\nsupporting his wife and daughter on a hundred and twenty pounds a year\\r\\nbut as he looked back on it such things were forgotten and it seemed\\r\\nto him that his life there had been a happy one for it had been shared\\r\\nwith the woman he loved Setting down his candle he turned over the\\r\\nJapanese screen which he had always liked for the storks flying across\\r\\nit embroidered in silver thread His wife had intended to recover\\r\\nthe screen for the storks were tarnished and the silver threads\\r\\nunravelling but she had died before she had found a suitable piece of\\r\\nstuff She is in Heaven he said mechanically and was surprised once\\r\\nagain that the words with which he comforted others held no consolation\\r\\nfor him\\r\\n\\r\\nAn old age passed together would have brought a closer understanding\\r\\nbetween us he said suddenly speaking his innermost thought which\\r\\nhe had not admitted to himself before for the clergymans tragedy was\\r\\nnever to have had the conviction of perfect understanding or intimacy\\r\\neven with his wife\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle years of life we live too much in the affairs of the\\r\\nday and a child troubles the mind of its mother So many burdens to\\r\\nbe borne so many duties to be fulfilled We were too occupied to\\r\\nlook into each others hearts and old age the sweetest portion of\\r\\nlife if it be filled with harmony and the happiness of memories shared\\r\\nin common old age is reserved for me only a lonely and miserable old\\r\\nage Now that I have lost Mavis intimacy is impossible with anyone\\r\\nelse and I feel myself growing far away from everyone and farthest\\r\\nof all from Anne She reminds me too closely of her mother I find it\\r\\npainful to be with her and I find her youth as tiresome as she finds my\\r\\nhasty temper\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Dunnock told himself that such feelings must be controlled but\\r\\nhe had said that before and had no faith that the strangeness which\\r\\nseemed to be growing upon him could be overcome Death will release\\r\\nme and I must console myself with the hope that Mavis is waiting\\r\\nfor me in Heaven that she will fold me in her wings and take me to\\r\\nherself without a word of reproach When I hear the birds singing in\\r\\nthe mornings they repeat that promise and once or twice I have had the\\r\\nconviction that when I looked out of our bedroom window I should see\\r\\nangels perched in the branches of the trees\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three pairs of skates lay on a shelf the blades had been smeared\\r\\nwith vaseline and wrapped in greaseproof paper but the boots were\\r\\ndusty and stretched stiffly over the boxwood trees\\r\\n\\r\\nYes yes the skates will be all right there will be nothing amiss\\r\\nwith them for they had been greased by _her_ hands it was _she_ who\\r\\nhad laid them aside after the frost last winter a few weeks before her\\r\\ndeath\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road to Bluntisham was long and as she walked with her father\\r\\nAnne thought about bicycles Her father had once had a bicycle but\\r\\nthat was many years ago he appeared to have no wish to possess\\r\\nanother and Anne had never summoned up sufficient courage to buy\\r\\none for herself though the price of a bicycle was lying idly in the\\r\\nsavings bank at the Post Office\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall certainly buy a bicycle she thought It is madness not to\\r\\nhave got one before a bicycle would give me the freedom for which I\\r\\npine what the horse is to the Arab of the desert a bicycle is to a\\r\\ngirl in my position I could ride to Cambridge in Cambridge I could go\\r\\nto concerts and even plays I could ride to Peterborough But she\\r\\ndid not finish her thought for she was uncertain what Peterborough\\r\\nwould give her\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had a bicycle I should make friends and instead of wasting my\\r\\nlife like a fool dreaming about acrobats at a travelling circus I\\r\\nshould meet Cambridge undergraduates and receive invitations to play\\r\\ntennis or to join in a picnic party on the river\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Anne was thinking of all the changes which would come into her\\r\\nlife when she bought herself a bicycle her father was enjoying the\\r\\nexercise of walking\\r\\n\\r\\nI am a great pedestrian he had said to the Bishop and although he\\r\\nscarcely ever went outside his house if he could avoid it the saying\\r\\nwas true and it was all his daughter could do to keep up with him\\r\\n\\r\\nBluntisham Church stands as the last outpost over the flooded fen\\r\\ncountry a little beyond at Earith is the starting point of the\\r\\nBedford Level which runs for thirty miles to Kings Lynn without a\\r\\nhedge or a tree or even as much as a molehill to break the flat\\r\\nexpansegreen all the summer but under water or rather under ice\\r\\nwhen the Dunnocks approached it\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father and daughter had in common a great liking for the fens they\\r\\nloved the black peaty earth the vast level expanse of sodden land\\r\\nwhich looked flatter than the sea when viewed from the high banks\\r\\nof a causeway running through it or the embankments of the Bedford\\r\\nRiver raised up above the fields which it drained they liked even the\\r\\nsqualid villages on each side of the level the low houses clustering\\r\\nwherever a hillock projecting into the fenland made it possible for man\\r\\nto build But better than the Bedford Level of the present day they\\r\\nloved to think of the fens of the past and of the struggle to reclaim\\r\\nthem which had begun with the war between the Romans and the Iceni\\r\\nflitting from islet to islet in their osier coracles sheltering behind\\r\\nthe willows and making a night attack on the legionaries posted to\\r\\ndefend the bridge at Huntingdon\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they drew near Bluntisham they began to speak of these things\\r\\nand Mr Dunnock soon passed from the invasions of the Danes to the\\r\\nprosperous farmers who tilled the lands reclaimed by the Romans until\\r\\nthe twelfth or fourteenth century when the fields relapsed into\\r\\nfenland and soon they reached the great days of the seventeenth\\r\\ncentury for as Mr Dunnock said the history of the Commonwealth\\r\\nis to be found in the Fens of Huntingdonshire and the Commonwealth\\r\\nitself may be regarded as a mere episode in the struggle between the\\r\\nUplanders and the Lowlanders\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Mr Dunnock was an Uplander by birth and a High Churchman he\\r\\nwas proud of the part that the inhabitants of the swamps had played in\\r\\nEnglish history\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout the three men of Godmanchester there would have been no Magna\\r\\nCharta and if Charles had not tried to drain the Fens there is little\\r\\ndoubt he would have won the Civil War he said and went on telling\\r\\nAnne how as a young man Oliver must have made the reflection that his\\r\\nfamily had been ruined by the Stuarts who had encouraged their hopes\\r\\nand given them nothing It was a good reason for him to repent of his\\r\\nloose life and become more determined a Puritan Soon he was stirring\\r\\nup trouble against the church in St Ives then his uncle Sir Thomas\\r\\nSteward died leaving him his heir and Oliver removed to Ely but the\\r\\ntemptation to make trouble still persisted and when one next hears of\\r\\nhim he was giving money to the Fen Dwellers and helping them to resist\\r\\nthe drainage schemes of the Kings Adventurers\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventurers Fen is called after them said Anne and her father\\r\\nanswered that it might well be so and they stopped for a moment to\\r\\nlook out towards the fen in question\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time the people in the fens lived by fishing and wild\\r\\nfowling said Mr Dunnock Every week during the winter a train of\\r\\nwaggons left Linton for London loaded with wild duck and he continued\\r\\nhis story of how when the King was engaged in reclaiming the fen the\\r\\nbirds were driven from their nesting grounds and the great decoys\\r\\nwoven of osiers were being left high and dry so that the lowlanders\\r\\nforesaw that they would have to abandon a mode of livelihood which had\\r\\nendured since the Iceni They had no desire to plough and reap and the\\r\\ndrained lands did not prove fertile until a century afterwards when\\r\\nthe farmers were shown how to dig through the peat and quarry clay to\\r\\nmix with it after which it became the most fruitful soil in England\\r\\nOliver Cromwell had taken up their cause and later when the Duke of\\r\\nManchester was letting victory slip out of the hands of the Parliament\\r\\nit was Cromwell who impeached him and then seeking an army turned\\r\\nfor his New Model to the Fens It was Cromwell who equipped the\\r\\nLowlanders and headed the Eastern Association and it was the Eastern\\r\\nAssociation which had won the Civil War and so the Cromwells had their\\r\\nrevenge on the Stuarts But though the lowlanders had been made use of\\r\\nthe work of drainage went on and the Ironsides who had been enlisted\\r\\nto resist the draining of the fens were betrayed by old Ironsides\\r\\nhimself the Lord Protector\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by the time Mr Dunnock had reached this crowning example of the\\r\\nperfidy of the figure he so much hated they had turned the corner\\r\\nbelow Bluntisham Church and saw before them the great expanse of ice\\r\\ncovered with the descendants of Cromwells Ironsides\\r\\n\\r\\nThe field beside the road was full of motorcars of farmers gigs\\r\\nwaggonettes and grazing ponies and at the entrance stood the farmer\\r\\nasking a penny from every person who went on the ice No crop had\\r\\never yielded so handsome a profit as his flooded watermeadows and\\r\\nno fenman in Cromwells day would have fought more bitterly against a\\r\\nscheme which would have kept it drained during the winter months\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noise of hundreds of pairs of skates on the ice came to their ears\\r\\nas they entered the fielda grumbling sound that had within it a note\\r\\nwhich rang as clear as a bell and they sat down to unlace their boots\\r\\nrefusing the offer of a chair which would mean spending another penny\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was the first on the ice and as her father watched her hesitating\\r\\nstrokes the feeling of affection which the conversation about\\r\\nCromwell had aroused gave place to one of shame and irritation\\r\\n\\r\\nAm I to be tied to such a limpet all day he asked himself as he\\r\\nhad so often asked himself before when skating with his wife then\\r\\nwithout giving his daughter another look he hobbled rapidly to the\\r\\nedge of the ice and was off himself slipping away as easily as a\\r\\nswallow that recovers the freedom of its element after beating against\\r\\nthe windowpanes His own strokes were as effortless as the flickering\\r\\nof a birds wing and it was impossible for the onlookers watching him\\r\\nto say what kept him in motion Mr Dunnock never appeared to strike\\r\\noff but leant gracefully forward lifting a leg slightly to cross\\r\\nhis feet and changing his weight from one leg to the other he flew\\r\\nlazily across the ice picking his way without appearing to observe\\r\\nthe existence of the clumsy young farmers who doubled up and with\\r\\ntheir hands clasped behind their backs dashed round and round at top\\r\\nspeed on their long fen skates Soon everyone had noticed the tall\\r\\nclergyman with his beard tucked under a white woollen muffler and many\\r\\npaused to watch as he began figureskating in the real English style\\r\\nEight after eight was drawn with the slow precision of a sleepy rook\\r\\nwheeling in the evening sky before descending in a perfect spiral to\\r\\nroost on the topmost bough of the high elm and indeed the blackcoated\\r\\nfigure forgot for a few moments that he was an elderly vicar on a\\r\\npair of skates and believed himself to be circling in space among a\\r\\nvast flock of waterfowl flying over the fens It seemed to him as if\\r\\nat intervals a Vshaped band of wild duck flashed past him each with\\r\\nits neck craned forward and beating furiously with its short clumsy\\r\\nwings a flock of curlew was all about him and would wheel suddenly in\\r\\nits tracks with a flash of white then a stray snipe corkscrewed past\\r\\na pair of greedy seagulls chased each other and two roseate terns\\r\\nrevolved round each other on their nuptial flight\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf an hour had gone by when his dream was interrupted by a young\\r\\nman with pink cheeks and rather protruding black eyes who skated up\\r\\nto him and addressed him by name It was Mr Yockney Dr Boulders\\r\\nassistant whose professional duties brought him to Dry Coulter when\\r\\nthere was a birth or death but rarely at other timesthe villagers\\r\\nwere uncommonly healthy and on the rare occasions when they took cold\\r\\nor developed inflammation of the lungs they doctored each other with\\r\\ngaseous mixture or turpentine and honey\\r\\n\\r\\nAh so you are here said Mr Dunnock shaking hands warmly for\\r\\nyoung Yockney had attended Mrs Dunnock in her last illness and his\\r\\nsympathy and tenderness to the dying woman would never be forgotten\\r\\n\\r\\nYes Doctor Boulder gave me the day off This frost is so healthy we\\r\\nhave no patients left but its an illwind that blows nobody any good\\r\\nand I would not miss a days skating like this for the world\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Dunnock said that Doctor Boulder must write to the Clerk of the\\r\\nWeather about the deplorably healthy winter Mr Yockney laughed and\\r\\nthen both of them remembered that it must be lunch time\\r\\n\\r\\nCome Yockney you must join us said Mr Dunnock and Anne coming\\r\\nup at that moment added her invitation which the young man was glad\\r\\nenough to accept\\r\\n\\r\\nA line of trestles had been put up on the ice and crowds were waiting\\r\\nround the shoemakers and the men who let out skates for hire\\r\\nbut most popular of all were the sellers of hot potatoes and roast\\r\\nchestnuts with their buckets of glowing coals Mr Yockney purchased\\r\\nthree steaming cups of cocoa while Anne went to fetch the satchel full\\r\\nof sandwiches and in a little while they were sitting on the edge of a\\r\\ngrassy bank\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been seeing a friend of yours Miss Dunnock said the doctor\\r\\nafter the second sandwich Little Rachel Sotheby and I fear that it\\r\\nmay have been your doing that I had to be called in for I understand\\r\\nit was you who took her to the circus She caught a chill on the way\\r\\nback Oh no it is nothing in the least serious though she is rather\\r\\ndelicate\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne expressed her concern and hastened to explain to her father how\\r\\nshe had met the Sothebys in the teashop and had taken the little girl\\r\\nto see the circus\\r\\n\\r\\nExtraordinary chap that old grocer is said Mr Yockney Hed\\r\\nhave been a rich man by now I fancy if it had not been for that\\r\\ngoodfornothing son of his Just fancy he told me that he was\\r\\nspending all his money on making his son a gentleman\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seemed to Mr Dunnock an excellent joke and he laughed heartily\\r\\nHe disliked the grocer for his assurance and his cheerfulness and his\\r\\nnonconformity and was ready to hear anything to his disadvantage\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great news continued Mr Yockney only I expect you know it is\\r\\nthat the prodigal is expected home next week Hes been in Paris and\\r\\nhas been going the pace a bit I fancy\\r\\n\\r\\nOh I am so glad said Anne with real interest showing in her\\r\\nvoice I have heard so much about him from Mr Sotheby and I quite\\r\\nlook forward to seeing what hes like He sounds quite an interesting\\r\\nperson\\r\\n\\r\\nA frown gathered on her fathers face\\r\\n\\r\\nYes we are all eager to see him said the doctor and then the\\r\\ntone of his voice changed so completely that Anne could see that it\\r\\nwas another and a serious Mr Yockney who was speaking although she\\r\\nobserved that his eyes bulged just as much when he was serious as when\\r\\nhe was only talking lightly\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you ask me Miss Dunnock I should say that young man is the very\\r\\nworst type of rotter Look at the old grocer sweating away at sixty\\r\\nlook at his mother still serving in the shop look at his little\\r\\nsister with patches on the sides of her boots while Master Richard\\r\\nis learning to be a _gentleman_ in Paris Theres no word too bad for\\r\\nhim I should like him to know what decent people think of that sort of\\r\\ngentility\\r\\n\\r\\nYou had better tell him my dear fellow said Mr Dunnock languidly\\r\\nIt would do him a world of good Ive no doubt But I must say it\\r\\nis probably not the fault of the son but because of the vanity of\\r\\nthe father Over and over again I have seen a young oaf of that\\r\\ndescription produced by a couple of vain and silly parents who ruin\\r\\ntheir childrens lives by denying them nothing\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no decent chap you must admit said Mr Yockney\\r\\n\\r\\nYou think the son is to blame because you are nearer his age and\\r\\nimagine yourself in his position said Mr Dunnock with a smile But\\r\\nI as a father imagine myself in the position of our excellent grocer\\r\\nIf I were to bring Anne up to expect luxuries and to suppose that she\\r\\nwas born to lead an idle useless existence it would not be her fault\\r\\nif she grew up a silly and discontented woman\\r\\n\\r\\nEven without this argument Anne was feeling decidedly uncomfortable\\r\\nand a clumsy piece of gallantry from Mr Yockney added to her\\r\\nirritation\\r\\n\\r\\nStupid coarse hidebound brute Do your eyes bulge because of your\\r\\nmanly virtue she said under her breath but she had to confess that\\r\\nthere was something in what the doctor had said She had not noticed\\r\\nthe patches on Rachels boots herself and she felt her respect for Mr\\r\\nYockney as a doctor increasing with her dislike of him as a man If it\\r\\nwere true it was disgraceful that Rachel should not have a sound pair\\r\\nof boots but it was absurd to object to Mrs Sotheby serving in the\\r\\nshop would she have been happier at a hydro in Harrogate\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Dunnock had continued a whimsical description of how he might have\\r\\nbrought up his daughter so that she would have been discontented with\\r\\nher life the doctor replied but finally they agreed that both of the\\r\\nSothebys father and son were very much to blame when Anne remarked\\r\\nin a voice which trembled that she was fond of the Sothebys and that\\r\\nshe thought that it was very fine of them to sacrifice themselves in\\r\\norder to make their son a great artist\\r\\n\\r\\nI can trust you not to be taken in by the word _gentleman_ Anne\\r\\nbut I am afraid you may be by the word _artist_ Art you know Mr\\r\\nYockney covers a multitude of sins\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best definition of art I have ever heard said the doctor is\\r\\nthat it is the opposite of work Mr Dunnock laughed approvingly\\r\\nand Mr Yockney went on his eyes bulging more than ever with the\\r\\nseriousness of his appeal\\r\\n\\r\\nNo Miss Dunnock whatever you may say I know that the kind of\\r\\ncaddish selfishness we have been talking about is absolutely abhorrent\\r\\nto you as it is to all decent people I quite agree with you that\\r\\nthere is something pathetic in the old Sothebys but there is nothing\\r\\nto be said for the son\\r\\n\\r\\nWell they seem to be an unusually happy family answered Anne\\r\\nfeeling that she had lost her temper\\r\\n\\r\\nI am too old to play at Happy Families any longer said her father\\r\\nwith a titter I shall go back to the ice and leave Mr Yockney and\\r\\nyou to settle the momentous question of Master Grits the Grocers son\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSIX WINGED SEEDS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy is it Anne Dunnock asked herself next day that my father can\\r\\nbe pleasant to other people but not to me Though to be sure I fancied\\r\\nyesterday that his pleasantness to Mr Yockney was a trifle vulgar\\r\\nwhile his unpleasantness to me has at all events the merit of being\\r\\nsincere and wellbred And Anne told herself that the only explanation\\r\\nmust be that she was as much a burden to her father as he was to her\\r\\nBut only I realize it she burst out For I am young enough to\\r\\nrecognize the truth and to welcome it he does not understand himself\\r\\nor other people all his life he has hidden his head in the sand like\\r\\nan ostrich and after all what else can one expect of a clergyman\\r\\n\\r\\nHer anger had lasted since the conversation about the Sothebys for her\\r\\nirritation during the lunch beside the ice had been quickly followed by\\r\\nfatigue which had intensified her resentment After the unaccustomed\\r\\nexercise her ankles seemed to have turned to jelly and the eightmile\\r\\nwalk from Bluntisham had been torture to her\\r\\n\\r\\nNever again she said to herself and when Mr Lambert had stopped\\r\\nat the door next morning to offer her a place in his gig he was going\\r\\nto Bluntisham for the skating she had refused and her father had\\r\\naccepted in her place\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I want any skating I shall go on the Broad Ditch she had said\\r\\na remark which had estranged Mr Dunnock more than her sullenness the\\r\\nprevious day had done and he drove off with a hurt look which said\\r\\nYou are no daughter of mine to speak of skating in such a way before a\\r\\nstranger\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gig was out of sight Anne went indoors to write a letter to\\r\\nCoventry for a catalogue of bicycles\\r\\n\\r\\nThe catalogue came but though she selected a machine she hesitated\\r\\nto post the letter ordering it and after a weeks indecision she tore\\r\\nit up since the thought had come to her that a bicycle would tie her\\r\\nmore firmly than ever to her life with her father and this life seemed\\r\\nevery day to become less endurable\\r\\n\\r\\nA thaw followed quickly on the second day of skating and after that\\r\\nrain and sleet fell for several days Mr Dunnock appeared to be\\r\\nequally disgusted by the weather and by his daughter and retired to\\r\\nhis study scarcely a word being exchanged throughout the day except\\r\\nat breakfast when Mr Dunnock always reminded Anne of her duties in\\r\\nthe parish\\r\\n\\r\\nA bicycle would rivet me to my present life said Anne to herself\\r\\nWhat a chain is to a yarddog a bicycle is to the daughter of a\\r\\nclergyman A bicycle would give me a certain radius of movement it\\r\\nwould fill the emptiness of my life but I want things that no bicycle\\r\\ncan give me Yes I want books music beautiful clothes and more\\r\\nthan any of these I want what they stand for that is the society of\\r\\nintelligent men and cultivated women Such hopes are vain I know\\r\\nI shall never succeed in unwinding the accursed chainstill I\\r\\nshall attempt it and the best way to set about it is certainly not by\\r\\nentangling myself with a bicycle Even if I had to live in solitude I\\r\\nshould prefer independence and that I can achieve for the world is\\r\\nfull of women who earn their own living Ten pounds is more valuable to\\r\\nme than a machine with plated rims or a little oilbath no one ever\\r\\nran away from home on a bicycle and I shall want all my savings for a\\r\\nrailway ticket and lodgings in London while I look about me\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the letter ordering the bicycle was torn up and the catalogue\\r\\nitself cast into the fire since it was a temptation to the flesh one\\r\\nwhich assailed her particularly in the evenings the ten pounds was\\r\\nreplaced to her credit in the Savings Bank and several days were spent\\r\\nin turning over the best way of earning her living\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall go away from here that is clear she said I have known\\r\\nthat ever since the ploughmen came that snowy morning Here the\\r\\naccursed chain can never be unwound but when I am living a free life\\r\\namong new people and my father is forgotten I shall escape and\\r\\nspeaking easily to everyone I shall be accepted by them I shall love\\r\\nI shall be beloved Anne shook her head and a shower of hairpins\\r\\nflew out on to the floor\\r\\n\\r\\nDamn the elastic stuff she cried Why do I endure it a moment\\r\\nlonger and tears coming into her eyes she started up and seized a\\r\\npair of scissors out of her workbasket\\r\\n\\r\\nThere will be time enough for that later on and the scissors were\\r\\ndropped as she told herself that she must plan for the future and not\\r\\ndissipate her emotions in the present\\r\\n\\r\\nYet another week was spent in considering how she could earn her\\r\\nliving and March came in like a lamb before she had arrived at any\\r\\npractical decision\\r\\n\\r\\nThe birds sing and build their nests soon they will be laying their\\r\\neggs and then father will be in agonies whenever a young thrush\\r\\nhops across the lawn lest it should fall between Pussys paws The\\r\\nsnowdrops are over long ago the hyacinths have broken through the\\r\\nground their fat buds look like pinecones First came the daffodils\\r\\nthe double ones and then the single The peaches are showing their\\r\\npink petals on the walls of the dove house but I remain where I am I\\r\\ncannot flower unfold my petals or spread my wings\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen her father spoke to her of the migrant birds flitting northwards\\r\\nthrough Africa and Spain and Italy and France from bush to bush\\r\\ntwenty yards by twenty yards to find their way to Englands shores\\r\\nwhere alone they find the happiness of love said Mr Dunnock and\\r\\nwhere alone they sing Anne vowed fiercely that before the last of the\\r\\nmigrants arrived she would be gone herself\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cuckoo will be here in six weeks said she to herself The\\r\\nnightingale will be here a week after I shall stay to hear one but\\r\\nnot the other Which it will be I cannot tell for sometimes the\\r\\nnightingale comes before the cuckoo and that they say is the luckier\\r\\nI hope I shall hear the nightingale before I go and not the cuckoo it\\r\\nwould be an omen that I should find a true lover waiting for me and\\r\\nnot a deceiver\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spring pleased her and excited her and an hour or two was spent\\r\\nhappily searching for the first wild flowers and gathering the\\r\\nsweetscented white violets which grew under the old apple trees but\\r\\nmeeting her father at lunch and hearing him speak to her of the Sunday\\r\\nschool reminded her of her resolution to leave him and at that moment\\r\\nthe beauty of the springtime seemed nothing but a reflection of the\\r\\nweakness of her character\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can I leave him He is helpless and I am useful to him Who will\\r\\nteach in the Sunday school Who will keep up the thin pretence that\\r\\nhe cares what happens to his parishioners when I am gone Without me\\r\\nwho will order his meals and who will keep a watch on the bacon The\\r\\nPattles will rob him they will eat him out of house and home But\\r\\nthough it seemed that it was impossible for her to leave her father\\r\\nhelpless and though Anne knew that she loved him she was soon going\\r\\nover her old arguments about how a girl can earn her living\\r\\n\\r\\nAll her experiences had been no more than to pour out tea and to\\r\\nteach in the Sunday school Other women of her age she knew were able\\r\\nto be bank clerks or the secretaries of business men they worked in\\r\\nGovernment offices they did typewriting indeed there seemed nothing\\r\\nthat women did not do but Anne doubted very much whether she could\\r\\nbecome a useful person of that kind She had received what Mr Dunnock\\r\\nhad called the education of a lady that was no education at all\\r\\nshe could not add up columns of figures or use a typewriter or write\\r\\nin shorthand All she could do was to keep the children quiet to tell\\r\\nthem Bible stories about Balaams ass and Daniel in the den of lions\\r\\nshe could order the groceries check the washing arrange a bowl of\\r\\nflowers speak boardingschool French and struggle somehow through a\\r\\npiece of Schumannletting the hammer notes sound rather weak as her\\r\\nfingers tired\\r\\n\\r\\nTo earn her living seemed impossible unless she were to succeed with\\r\\nher fashion plates or were to exchange one Sunday school for another\\r\\nThat was always possible and in another parish she would meet with a\\r\\ncurate who would ask her to marry him for nowhere could a curate find\\r\\na better wife\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter a bicycle than a curate she exclaimed I would rather cut my\\r\\nthroat than be the wife of a clergyman Other duties perhaps I might\\r\\nface but I have not the courage to work all my life for parishioners\\r\\nwho prefer to go to their own chapels or to the publichouse It is\\r\\nthe fashion plates or suicide\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then Anne remembered that there were many elderly ladies in the\\r\\nworld whose incomes permitted the keeping of a donkeycarriage with a\\r\\ncompanion to walk beside it Why should I not be such a companion\\r\\nshe asked In the winter her sciatica will require a change of\\r\\nclimate and we shall go away together to the Riviera or to Egypt\\r\\nAnd the rest of the afternoon was spent dreaming of the music she would\\r\\nbe hearing at Rome of seeing the Sphinx by moonlight and visiting\\r\\nTutankhamens grave\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the evening she had decided to put an advertisement in _The Church\\r\\nTimes_ and at night lay awake repeating to herself the magic words\\r\\nwhich would bring her freedom A welleducated girl daughter of a\\r\\nclergyman requires situation as companion to a lady of means No\\r\\nthat did not sound well should she call herself a respectable girl\\r\\nNo not a respectable girlthat smacked of the kitchen A quiet girl\\r\\nwith an oldfashioned education desires to become the paid companion\\r\\nof a lady Nothing would do but nevertheless the advertisement would\\r\\nhave to be sent and finding sleep impossible Anne took pen and paper\\r\\nand wrote first one sentence and then another until she had covered\\r\\nseveral sheets\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning all her efforts seemed vain but at last she decided on\\r\\nsending the sentence which seemed to her to be the clearest Young\\r\\nlady who has enjoyed a religious upbringing wishes to see the world\\r\\nas the paid companion of a lady There was nothing more required but a\\r\\ncovering letter to the newspaper and a postal order\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne put on her boots and hurried out into the blustering March wind\\r\\nIt had broken the first hyacinth and the daffodils were lying flat on\\r\\nthe earth How the wind roared It was pleasant to be out of the house\\r\\nfor the chimneys had been smoking The grass on the lawn was lashed\\r\\ninto white streaks by the wind before which the hens ran sideways like\\r\\nold ladies crossing the road There was a thick scum at one side of the\\r\\nbroad ditch a scum of withered catkins fallen from the black poplars\\r\\nCatkins hung like funereal trappings or like black caterpillars on\\r\\nevery twig of the apple trees on the ditch the ducks were dancing on\\r\\nthe waves\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a wind as this scatters the seeds said Anne The winged fruits\\r\\nof the elms and the maples are whirled up from the ditches where they\\r\\nhave been lying all the winter and are carried over the tops of the\\r\\ntallest trees and this wind will gather me up like a seed that has\\r\\nlain too long under the tree from which it fell Heaven knows where it\\r\\nwill carry me To Egypt or Greece maybe or perhaps only to pull the\\r\\nrug over the knees of an old lady driving her donkeycart along the\\r\\nlanes of an adjoining parish\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the avenue of elms the wind roared so loud that Anne feared for\\r\\nthe safety of the trees and stepped cautiously looking up among the\\r\\nswaying branches In her hand she held the precious letter that was to\\r\\nset her free the letter which was to her as the wing is to the seed\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce this is posted there is no turning back she thought There\\r\\nwill be difficulties but they will be overcome and when I look back\\r\\non my life I shall say it began on the day when I posted this letter\\r\\nand I shall remember the March gale roaring like a lion among the elms\\r\\n\\r\\nA vision of an elderly lady with soft brown eyes like bees and short\\r\\ngrey hair haunted her a precise lady she would be perhaps one who\\r\\nhad been an actress or an opera singer in her day and kept a casket\\r\\nof loveletters from all the poets of the eighties standing on the\\r\\ntable beside her Her employer would laugh gently at her enthusiasm\\r\\nand would tell her wonderful anecdotes Her name would be beautiful\\r\\nand familiar a name that is to be found in every catalogue of roses\\r\\nfor she was the kind of lady after whom roses are named Anne would\\r\\ntake the place of a daughter and would soon inherit all her passionate\\r\\nfire tempered by her knowledge of the world all her deep wisdom born\\r\\nof experience and of renunciation all her cynical clearsighted witty\\r\\ntenderness\\r\\n\\r\\nGood morning Miss Dunnock Annes daydream was interrupted and\\r\\nshe looked down to find Rachel Sotheby standing before her her bright\\r\\neyes shining and her cheeks flushed by the wind Anne was pleased to\\r\\nsee the little girl and thinking that they must part soon she bent\\r\\ndown to kiss her a thing she had not done before As she did so she\\r\\nremembered Mr Yockneys remark about Rachels boots and glanced at\\r\\nthem Yes they were stiff little boots cracked behind the toecaps\\r\\nworn out they would let in the water\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Yockney was quite right she said to herself and entering the\\r\\nPost Office was embarrassed to find a stranger standing at the counter\\r\\nwriting a telegram\\r\\n\\r\\nThis must be Rachels brother she thought as she recognized the\\r\\nfoxey nose and the slit eyes of the photograph she had seen in the\\r\\ngrocers parlour This must be Richard Sotheby who has been turned\\r\\ninto a gentleman while his sister has holes in her boots\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Anne asked for her postal order she avoided looking at the young\\r\\nman of whom she had heard so much but while she was waiting for\\r\\nthe pen there was only one in the Post Office with which it was\\r\\npossible to write she could not keep her eyes turned away and when\\r\\nhe had finished his telegram she had to meet his eye as he handed\\r\\nher the pen The action was polite but though their eyes met for an\\r\\ninstant she could see that it was mechanical she had not engaged his\\r\\nattention he was thinking of his telegram and next moment she heard\\r\\nhim spelling it over to Mrs Day the postmistress and explaining\\r\\nthat it was in French\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Church Times_ wrote Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nGRANDISON spelt the young man\\r\\n\\r\\nBarclays Bank and Co wrote Anne keeping her ears open but failing\\r\\nto follow the address\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had filled in her postal order and had sealed up her letter there\\r\\nwas no reason to stay longer listening while Mrs Day repeated the\\r\\nletters after him and she went out posted her letter and turned\\r\\nhomewards Already her emotions about her advertisement had subsided\\r\\nand as she hurried under the stormtossed elms her thoughts were\\r\\noccupied with the grocers son and his strange telegram\\r\\n\\r\\nJe suis las de tes amourettes et de mon amour Je consens Ecris\\r\\nWhat did that mean And who was the Grandison to whom it was addressed\\r\\n\\r\\nHer meditations were interrupted by Richard Sotheby himself who passed\\r\\nher walking rapidly down the avenue His hat was jammed hard on his\\r\\nhead he did not lift it and directly he had passed she noticed that\\r\\nhe was wearing button boots made of patent leather\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSEVEN THE BURNT FARM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe March gale continued for several days the daffodils were broken\\r\\nthe hyacinths in the border laid low but one morning Anne awoke to\\r\\nfind that not a breath of wind was stirring in the elms and after an\\r\\nhour or so the sun was blazing with the heat of June On the breakfast\\r\\ntable lay _The Church Times_ and she trembled with emotion when she\\r\\nsaw it in her fathers hands\\r\\n\\r\\nI must speak to him she said to herself I must speak to him now\\r\\nbut she did not speak consoling herself for her lack of resolution\\r\\nwith the thought that the earliest answers to her advertisement could\\r\\nnot arrive for two days since they were to be forwarded from the\\r\\noffice in Fleet Street she had not given her name and address but had\\r\\nused a box number\\r\\n\\r\\nI will speak to him tomorrow she said to herself For I would like\\r\\nto enjoy one day of perfect spring weather before I leave Dry Coulter\\r\\nand our conversation is certain to upset us\\r\\n\\r\\nShe waited eagerly until the birds breakfast left her free to take\\r\\nthe newspaper into her hands Her advertisement was in and reading\\r\\nthe modest three lines Anne felt her heart swell with the triumph of\\r\\nauthorship and she ran upstairs with _The Church Times_ in her hand to\\r\\nread the announcement over and over to herself in private\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no turning back now she exclaimed I have shown my\\r\\nindependence I have taken the first step and nothing now can keep me\\r\\nfrom achieving my purpose\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnes eyes flashed as she turned to the lookingglass and the\\r\\neager look she met there intoxicated her at that moment she almost\\r\\nsuffocated with the sense of her own power The blood rushed to her\\r\\nhead and she clenched her fists and ground her teeth in the effort to\\r\\nremain calm\\r\\n\\r\\nHave you seen _The Church Times_ called Mr Dunnock coming back\\r\\nfrom watching the birds\\r\\n\\r\\nHere it is father she answered and running downstairs surrendered\\r\\nit to him without a tremor Her father took it absentmindedly saying\\r\\nas he did so\\r\\n\\r\\nI think there is some straw somewhere my dear Would you ask Noah to\\r\\nscatter it about the lawn It will be useful for the sparrows the\\r\\nnearest rick is several hundred yards away a long journey for them\\r\\nalmost an impossible one if the wind should veer to the east On a calm\\r\\nday like this it is not so important but there are not many calm days\\r\\nin March and in any case it will save a great deal of trouble\\r\\n\\r\\nAt another moment Anne might have been vexed at her fathers solicitude\\r\\nfor the hated sparrows but she was in a mood to forgive his follies\\r\\nand she ran off at once to the pottingshed to find the straw and\\r\\nscattered it on the lawn herself\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the morning she was beside herself with excitement and she found\\r\\nit hard to answer Maggie sensibly when she spoke of their plan of\\r\\nwhitewashing the scullery When the proposal had been put forward a\\r\\nfortnight before by Anne it had seemed to mark an epoch but Maggie\\r\\nfound that it was suddenly brushed on one side her feelings were hurt\\r\\nthe date was left uncertain and Anne had fled out into the garden\\r\\nbefore she had time to question her again\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first tulips were standing stiffly to attention in their fieldgrey\\r\\nuniforms their buds unopened but the girl could not think of tulips\\r\\nas she paced up and down the borders Her life at the vicarage was\\r\\ncoming to an end and she must speak to her father but after thinking\\r\\nover what she would say for an hour she could find no words and came\\r\\nto the conclusion that it would be unwise to open the subject before\\r\\nshe had decided where she was going Her father would be certain to\\r\\nraise objections and they would appear more formidable if her plans\\r\\nwere not fixed It would be better for both of them if the parting were\\r\\nto come suddenly\\r\\n\\r\\nI will go to him in his study she said when my bag is packed and\\r\\nwith this settled in her mind she felt happy for the first time that\\r\\nmorning She had come out to enjoy the warm spring weather but as\\r\\nsoon as she had decided not to speak to her father and before she had\\r\\ntime to look about her she saw Maggie waving from the kitchen door and\\r\\nknew that it was time for lunch\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the strain of making plans about her future she found the meal a\\r\\npleasant one emotion had given her an appetite and as she ate Anne\\r\\nenjoyed listening to her father inveighing against the stupidity of old\\r\\nNoah\\r\\n\\r\\nYou would scarcely believe it said Mr Dunnock but within half an\\r\\nhour of your having scattered the straw that old fool was sweeping it\\r\\nup I ordered him to stop but he would not listen to me until I had\\r\\ntaken him by the arm and had explained my reasons But so blind is the\\r\\nprejudice of the rustics about here that he said that he would as soon\\r\\npoison the sparrows as not I was forced to speak to him very severely\\r\\nIt is his first lapse since the question of the strawberry nets last\\r\\nyear\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mild sunlit air was full of bees as Anne left the vicarage after\\r\\nlunch the celandines were gaping in the sunlight on the bank above the\\r\\nBroad Ditch Wagtails ran round the waters edge goldfinches flew up\\r\\ninto the elms and yellowhammers trotted before her on the road\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she passed the Post Office she remembered Richard Sotheby and his\\r\\nstrange telegram and tired of the turmoil of her own emotion she\\r\\nwelcomed the memory I am tired of thy little love affairs and of my\\r\\nown love I consent Write And pondering over these words she asked\\r\\nherself what kind of creature the Grandison might be to whom they were\\r\\naddressed\\r\\n\\r\\nA rich woman in Paris it seemed reasonable to suppose who had\\r\\nbeen his mistress It is to secure her love that little Rachel\\r\\nis neglected Anne wondered what their life had been in Paris and\\r\\nslowly a picture of Miss Grandison formed itself clearly in her minda\\r\\nfair woman she must be with a white skin like the flesh of a hazel\\r\\nnut with fair almost colourless hair and light blue eyes a thick\\r\\nslightly aquiline nose That certainly was Miss Grandison and at\\r\\nthe opera she wore diamonds and was wrapped in white fur On summer\\r\\nevenings her habit must be to drive with Sotheby out of Paris in her\\r\\nlimousine to have supper in the open air of lobsters and cream\\r\\nraspberries and iced champagne As the night drew on she would\\r\\nbecome bored and drag young Sotheby after her to a vast hotel in Paris\\r\\nwhere they could dance all night The men in their starched shirtfronts\\r\\nwould turn pale and wilt in the small hours of the morning under the\\r\\ntropical palms but La Grandison would dance on and on ruthlessly\\r\\nfirst with one man and then with another Richard Sotheby would be\\r\\nforgotten a young man from the Peruvian Embassy would escort her home\\r\\nwhile Richard disconsolate and brokenhearted would be left to pay for\\r\\nthe buckets of iced champagne and the mounds of uneaten sandwiches\\r\\nNo wonder with such a woman that he should declare he was weary of\\r\\nher love affairs and of his love But there was a hint of jealousy in\\r\\nhis bitterness\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled contentedly Richard Sothebys telegram enabled her to\\r\\nsee her own life with more philosophy Soon she forgot to think and\\r\\nwalked slowly onwards happy in feeling the soft air caress her cheek\\r\\nin hearing the chatter of starlings in the orchard trees in looking\\r\\nabout her in idleness Ewes lay indolently on the green their lambs\\r\\nwere already strong on their legs and she watched the play of the pair\\r\\nnearest to her at one moment butting each other in the next skipping\\r\\nbehind each other or mounting on one another in amorous curvets and\\r\\nthen suddenly indifferent breaking off their play\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stream was still swollen though rain had not fallen for a week\\r\\nAnne crossed it by the little bridge beside the water splash and made\\r\\nher way across the green the sheep scattering as she passed On each\\r\\nside of the old track that led to the burnt farmhouse the blackthorn\\r\\nbushes were in flower The masses of frail blossom were full of the\\r\\nhumming of bees but as yet there were no wild flowers in the hedge\\r\\nonly an occasional celandine shone on the bank like a dropped sovereign\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fields on each side were hired by a farmer living at a distance\\r\\nthey were still cultivated and kept in some sort of repair but much\\r\\nhad gone to ruin since the farmhouse had been burnt The hedges had\\r\\nnot been cut for years there were forest trees in them and holes big\\r\\nenough for bullocks to wander through The great stretch of pasture by\\r\\nthe farm itself the home meadows where the prize herd of spotted cows\\r\\nused to be milked in the open that had gone out of cultivation and\\r\\nwas full of hawthorn bushes of the trailing briars of dogroses and of\\r\\nbrambles The finest pasture which had yielded the richest butter was\\r\\nbecome no more than a covert where the French partridges nested Of the\\r\\nfarmhouse itself there was nothing left but a few of the walls heaps\\r\\nof plaster where the nettles grew in summer and one or two blackened\\r\\nbeams The vegetable garden was a wilderness with a quarter of an acre\\r\\nof horseradish and matted gooseberry bushes buried in convolvulvus At\\r\\none side on a smooth expanse of turf stood the old square dove house\\r\\nas sound as the day it had been built and the pigeons came and went as\\r\\nthey had always done for the dove house was still used as a granary\\r\\nand the pigeons were the perquisite of a farmhand\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Anne came in front of the house it seemed strange to her to see\\r\\nthe fine iron gates with great ilexes on either side of them and the\\r\\nflagged path that ran so cleanly up to a mere heap of broken bricks\\r\\nwhere the front door had been Not a weed had taken root on the\\r\\npathway not a bramble strayed across it and even the pond by whose\\r\\nbricked side it ran was clear water Irises grew there and flowered\\r\\nin the summer time on the grassy bank opposite there were daffodils\\r\\nin bloom Anne let herself in at the iron gates thinking to herself\\r\\nthat it was very strange that no farmhouse had been rebuilt there on\\r\\nthe site of the old one that no labourer had been allowed to work\\r\\nthe rich garden as his allotment and that it was impossible to guess\\r\\nwhy everything should have been let go to ruin except the square dove\\r\\nhouse of red brick which must have stood for three centuries and which\\r\\nlooked as if it would stand for as many more All about there were\\r\\nthe traces of a former fruitfulness a great walnut overshadowed one\\r\\nof the ancient yards by the edge of the pond and on the other side\\r\\nhidden in an impenetrable thicket of bullaces giant pear trees and\\r\\nplum suckers laced about with bramble and dogrose was the orchard\\r\\nThe plums were bursting into a fine blow and Anne wondered whether the\\r\\nboys came there to rob the fruit or whether the plums and apples fell\\r\\nof their own weight or hung until the wasps had hollowed out the last\\r\\nof them She wondered how it was that she had never met anyone by the\\r\\nBurnt Farm never a child nor a village labourer She had not seen it\\r\\nbefore in spring though in the summer it had been a favourite haunt of\\r\\nhers and she had gathered roses there late on into the autumn from a\\r\\nbush which had not yet gone wild As she walked up the path she smelt a\\r\\nbreath of wood smoke and turning the corner of the house by what had\\r\\nbeen the chimney stack she saw tongues of flame shooting up and heard\\r\\nthe crackle of sticks A tramp or perhaps an encampment of gipsies\\r\\nshe said to herself and would have drawn back but at that instant she\\r\\ncaught sight of Rachel Sotheby coming from the orchard with an armful\\r\\nof dry sticks\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy Rachel are you having a picnic here she asked seeing a kettle\\r\\non the fire\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel came running to her with eyes that shone with excitement she\\r\\nhad lost her grave look of selfpossession so that it was natural for\\r\\nAnne to stoop to kiss her for the second time seduced by her wild look\\r\\nand her tangled curls\\r\\n\\r\\nYes Miss Dunnock Do you come here often I have never been here\\r\\nbefore but my brother brought me He is sketching the house from the\\r\\nother side\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne would have taken her leave on hearing of Richard Sothebys\\r\\npresence but Rachel would not let her go before she had gathered her\\r\\nsome daffodils from the far side of the pond and had shown her the\\r\\nwhite violets growing under the walnut tree The kettle had not boiled\\r\\nwhen they came back to the fire and as Richard Sotheby was nowhere to\\r\\nbe seen she sat down for a little while talking to the little girl\\r\\nwhile she heaped up the sticks and unpacked the basket A minute passed\\r\\nwhen suddenly she heard a step and jumping up saw that Richard\\r\\nSotheby was standing a yard or two behind her He was bareheaded\\r\\nfrowning his lips twitching and seeing Anne at the same moment as she\\r\\nsaw him he gave his sister rather a puzzled glance\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is my brother Richard said Rachel looking up from blowing the\\r\\nfire Richard this is Miss Dunnock\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young mans face broke into smiles at her name and he held out his\\r\\nhand\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very pleased to meet you said Anne taking it Now I must be\\r\\ngetting on Goodbye Rachel\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease dont go said the grocers son I have finished work for\\r\\ntoday the light has changed and I have been wanting to meet you I\\r\\nwant to ask you all about how your doorstep was ploughed up I shall\\r\\nnever meet anyone else to whom such a thing has happened and I want to\\r\\nknow what it felt like\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was too much taken aback by this to know what to answer but just\\r\\nat that moment they were interrupted by Rachels saying that the tea\\r\\nwas made\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Sotheby repeated his invitation and Anne sat down on a block of\\r\\nstone which had once supported the corner of a haystack feeling very\\r\\nfoolish shy and ashamed of her shyness but she was determined that\\r\\nshe would not run away after what he had said She had blushed crimson\\r\\nwhen he had spoken of Plough Monday but it had pleased her to hear\\r\\nsomething spoken of openly about which so much must have been said\\r\\nbehind her back\\r\\n\\r\\nYes Our doorstep was ploughed up she said and her voice sounded to\\r\\nthe others as though she were angry Why does it interest you\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very wicked of the men to do it said Rachel suddenly And\\r\\nyou ought not to speak of such a thing to Miss Dunnock Richard\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grocers son laughed at his sisters indignant interruption\\r\\nRachel is a great friend of yours Miss Dunnock I shall have to\\r\\napologize to her but I hope I have not offended you also\\r\\n\\r\\nNo Not at all I want to talk about it Rachel she said looking at\\r\\nthe child The little girls mouth was trembling\\r\\n\\r\\nThat dont matter she said almost crying Richard did not ought to\\r\\nhave spoken to you of that thing Mother told everyone that what they\\r\\ndone was no better than if they were heathens and that no one was to\\r\\nsay a word about it No one would have ever but our Richard\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne took Rachel on to her knees and hugged the child close at that\\r\\nmoment she was near to tears herself for the first time in her life\\r\\nshe understood that she had neighbours who loved her and did not think\\r\\nof her only as a queer girl and the daughter of a queer clergyman\\r\\n\\r\\nSit here close to me she said letting the child go And let me\\r\\ntalk to your brother because he is very clever and is It was on\\r\\nthe tip of her tongue to say a gentleman but she altered it to\\r\\nbecause I am sure he would never be unkind\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel looked at him in a way which threatened that if he were unkind\\r\\nto Miss Dunnock there would be terrible consequences and Richard\\r\\nSotheby poured out the tea in silence until Anne asked him again why\\r\\nhe was interested in the ploughing up of the doorstep\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause it was as my mother said a heathenish act and I imagine\\r\\nthat like most heathen things it must have been beautiful\\r\\n\\r\\nYes it was beautiful replied Anne instantly It was so beautiful\\r\\nthat I was fascinated watching it and though I was crying with shame\\r\\nI was glad that they had done it\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Sotheby grinned with interest as Anne said this and nodded his\\r\\nhead several times\\r\\n\\r\\nLike a rape he said under his breath His words were not meant for\\r\\nAnne to hear but she had caught the word and for some minutes did not\\r\\nknow what to say or where to look but sat praying with all her soul\\r\\nthat she would not blush At last the danger passed and she went on\\r\\nto speak of the plough wobbling a little as it ran through the earth\\r\\nand of the broad shiny backs of the three chestnut horses and the\\r\\nhandsome face opposite her quickened with pleasure as she told how it\\r\\nhappened after a fall of snow and that there was snow on the horses\\r\\nmanes and on the carters caps\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had described the whole scene he pressed her for further\\r\\ndetails and soon she found that she was speaking of her feelings after\\r\\nthe event and that he was listening in silence She pulled herself up\\r\\nsuddenly unwilling to tell him so much about herself and there was\\r\\na long silence for the young man did not press her with questions\\r\\nbut the silence was broken at last by Anne saying But you cannot\\r\\nunderstand it unless I were to tell you about my father\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course it came about through him in the first place said Richard\\r\\nSotheby reflectively and Anne would have begun to speak of her father\\r\\nand her feelings for him if she had not felt Rachel shiver and then\\r\\nshe perceived that the sun was sinking low and that it had grown cold\\r\\nfor sitting out of doors\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is too long a story she said rising to her feet You would\\r\\nnot understand it and if you did it would bore you But it is late\\r\\nnow and I must be going home\\r\\n\\r\\nYou must promise to tell me another time said the grocers son If\\r\\nthe weather keeps fine I shall be working here every afternoon until\\r\\nabout halfpast three when the light changes Come and have tea with me\\r\\ntomorrow and finish your story\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne promised to come and then gathering up her flowers and saying\\r\\ngoodbye to Rachel she hurried off for young Sotheby had to go back\\r\\nto his easel and put it away in the dove house and she had no wish to\\r\\nbe seen walking home with him\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEIGHT WILLOWPATTERN PARIS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several days a gentle wind blew from the west and the cloudiness\\r\\nof dewdrenched mornings was followed by the sunshine and softness of\\r\\nthe afternoons Anne Dunnock knew that the grocers son was painting\\r\\nat the Burnt Farm but though each day she set out in that direction\\r\\nshe always turned aside on the way breaking her promise that she would\\r\\nmeet him there again\\r\\n\\r\\nI spoke to him too freely Heaven knows what he must think of me she\\r\\nrepeated to herself At moments she found it consoling to remember that\\r\\nshe felt quite sure that she did not like Richard Sotheby but at other\\r\\ntimes it seemed to her that what was so terrible was to have confided\\r\\nso much of her secret life to a man whom she disliked But the weather\\r\\nwas too beautiful for her to remain long unhappy for such reasons and\\r\\nnearly her whole day was spent out of doors In the morning she would\\r\\nbusy herself in the garden and tempted by the sunshine Mr Dunnock\\r\\nwould leave his study to come and stand beside her while she sowed the\\r\\nsweet peas and the mignonette or planted out young wallflowers in the\\r\\nborders\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not forget to sow teazles by the pond he would remind her They\\r\\nare as handsome as hollyhocks and wherever there have been teazles in\\r\\nsummer time the goldfinches will come in winter\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne did not regard the teazle as a weed she loved the plants bold\\r\\nleaves that hold hands about the prickly stem making a cup to catch\\r\\nthe rain and the flowerheads with their bands of blue which creep up\\r\\nand down the inflorescence\\r\\n\\r\\nFew words passed between father and daughter yet both were happy as\\r\\nthey went together to sow the teazle seed that he had saved and were\\r\\nconscious of being in sympathy with one another as they had scarcely\\r\\nbeen all the winter Once there was a rose tree to be transplanted on\\r\\nanother occasion a rambler which had been blown down had to be nailed\\r\\nup on the far side of the summerhouse and while Anne shovelled the\\r\\nearth round the roots and drove the nails through strips cut from an\\r\\nold stair carpet Mr Dunnock held the tree upright and the creeper in\\r\\nplace his hands protected in Noahs hedging gloves\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bees are working in the willows he said Though it is still\\r\\nthree weeks to Palm Sunday\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Anne had not abandoned her plan it was only that the spring and\\r\\nthe garden full of growing things had claimed her attention But one\\r\\nmorning she found a letter for her on the breakfast table and as she\\r\\nopened it her heart sank for she guessed that it was from a lady\\r\\nanxious to engage her as a companion\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat am I to say to him she asked herself looking up at her father\\r\\nas he came into the room and the morning was spent wandering about\\r\\nthe house first carrying an old trunk out of the boxroom to pack her\\r\\nthings and then with pale cheeks running to the door of her fathers\\r\\nstudy She did not knock when she stood trembling outside the door\\r\\nthough she knew that in a day or two at most perhaps even in a few\\r\\nhours she would be leaving the vicarage\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring luncheon she came nearest to speaking to her father but each\\r\\ntime just as she was going to begin she was interrupted by some\\r\\nremark of his Such a subject could not be opened without preparation\\r\\nwhen her father spoke of the decoration of the church at Easter her\\r\\ncourage failed her and before she had recovered it he had shaken the\\r\\ncrumbs off his waistcoat and had gone into his study\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall have to leave a letter for him to read after I am gone said\\r\\nAnne but the idea was hateful to her it revealed her own cowardice\\r\\ntoo clearly and when she began to compose the letter that should be\\r\\nleft behind she found the task an impossible one\\r\\n\\r\\nA walk will help me to think things out but in the road her\\r\\nfootsteps turned of themselves across the green and she was halfway\\r\\nto the Burnt Farm before she stopped suddenly realizing that she was\\r\\ngoing there to lay her difficulties before the grocers son\\r\\n\\r\\nThat will be the best way she said aloud In such a position as\\r\\nmine one must seek advice for it is only when one has been advised by\\r\\nsomeone else that one recovers confidence in the sanity of ones own\\r\\nopinions\\r\\n\\r\\nDirectly she had passed through the iron gates the sunshine seemed\\r\\nwarmer it was as hot as June she could see the daffodils clustering\\r\\non the banks of the pond and reflected in its waters a brimstone\\r\\nbutterfly rose from the flagged pathway and rambled in front of her\\r\\nsettling at last on one of the brick walls\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a continuous cooing from the top of the dove house and the\\r\\nbeat of the wings of the pigeons coming and going a blackbird was\\r\\nsinging in the tangled orchard\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel Sotheby was nowhere to be seen there was no fire burning but\\r\\nrecollecting that Richard Sotheby would be painting on the other side\\r\\nof the house Anne walked round into the wild garden She could not see\\r\\nhim and soon sat down putting her arms up to tidy her hair loosened\\r\\nby an angry toss of her head for she was vexed to have come looking\\r\\nfor the young man\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease stay like that said a sharp voice behind her and she looked\\r\\nround to find Richard Sotheby watching her from inside the ruined walls\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease stay where you are Miss Dunnock he repeated You are\\r\\nexactly what I want in my picture I knew there was something\\r\\nneedednow I see that it is a figure\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Anne jumped up before the sentence was finished and Richard\\r\\nSotheby climbed out of the ruin with his palette in his hand and a\\r\\nfrown on his face repeating Please stay there\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was insistent and Anne had to agree to sit for a few minutes while\\r\\nhe made a charcoal drawing\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I have finished you shall have tea he said as though he were\\r\\nspeaking to a child Anne sat looking up at the sky with her hands to\\r\\nher hair and her elbows up as he had posed her saying to herself that\\r\\nshe had never met anyone with such bad manners\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was hot with annoyance but soon the blush left her cheek and\\r\\nwhile she listened to the pigeons her resentment faded away\\r\\n\\r\\nMay I see your picture she asked five minutes later and when the\\r\\nartist refused shaking his head and laughing she felt no irritation\\r\\nIt seemed natural to her that he should say Not till it is finished\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen will that be she asked remembering her own departure\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will take me a week to put in that figure I dont know how I shall\\r\\ndo it unless you sit for me Come let us have tea\\r\\n\\r\\nI am afraid I cannot sit Mr Sotheby said Anne I have come today\\r\\nto say goodbye\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man opened his eyes at this his curiosity had to be\\r\\nsatisfied and soon Anne was telling him that her life was being wasted\\r\\nat the vicarage and that she was determined to leave her father\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Sotheby listened without saying a word he was kneeling in\\r\\nfront of the little fire he had just lighted The sticks smouldered\\r\\nbut went out when the paper had burnt away and she paused in her\\r\\nstory while he fetched a bottle of turpentine from his paintbox He\\r\\nsprinkled a little of the spirit and a thick yellow flame sprang up\\r\\nthen the sticks crackled All his attention seemed to be for the fire\\r\\nonly when she spoke of the advertisement he turned his head sharply to\\r\\nlook at her and when she told him that an answer had come that morning\\r\\nhe exclaimed Extraordinary under his breath\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what does your father say to all this he asked suddenly as he\\r\\nhanded her the cup of tea he had poured out Anne found the confession\\r\\nof her cowardice was difficult Sotheby was staring at her as if he\\r\\nwere surprised by her words\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that would be behaving very heartlessly he said when she had\\r\\ndone He filled the lid of the kettle with tea blew on it and added\\r\\nIt would be a great shock to him and it seems to me so unnecessary\\r\\nChildren have parents so much at their mercy their one duty to them\\r\\nsurely is to avoid shattering their illusions Im not a good son\\r\\nmy father is excessively irritating quite as irritating as yours I\\r\\ndont love him and that makes me feel ashamed You have left it so\\r\\nlate Do you really think that getting this place is worth having to\\r\\nbehave so badly\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnes face fell and rather sulkily she pulled the letter she had got\\r\\nthat morning out of her pocket\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Sotheby glanced at it wrinkled his nose and began reading it\\r\\naloud\\r\\n\\r\\n                                     Spion Kop\\r\\n                                      14A Kimberley Road\\r\\n                                         West Sutton

possible that you may suit me I am looking for a companion of gentle\\r\\n  birth who would be willing to undertake light duties in the house\\r\\n  I have a girl who comes in daily What I really require is someone\\r\\n  who will as far as possible take the place of my own devoted and\\r\\n  dearlyloved daughter who died last year after a long illness\\r\\n  patiently borne\\r\\n\\r\\n  I would introduce you to a pleasant circle of friends and would look\\r\\n  after you as I think you will agree a girl should be looked after\\r\\n  on coming so near London I cannot offer a high wage but you will\\r\\n  have every home comfort Will you please tell me in your answer\\r\\n  your age and whether you have been away from home before and when\\r\\n  you can come up for me to interview you It is essential that you\\r\\n  should be fond of dogs but no doubt you are This neighbourhood is\\r\\n  considered a very healthy one and the house is next door to the\\r\\n  church\\r\\n\\r\\n                                               Yours faithfully\\r\\n                                                         ETHEL CROWLINK\\r\\n\\r\\nEach phrase had sounded comic as he read it aloud and his voice ended\\r\\nwith such a queer note that Anne burst out laughing\\r\\n\\r\\nYou think I oughtnt to go to her she said\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is ridiculous to think of it he answered Not for your fathers\\r\\nsake but for your own It would be out of the fryingpan into the fire\\r\\nsurely you see that\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not answer and he went on Why should you choose to live with\\r\\nthe horrid old woman who wrote this letter in a London suburb If you\\r\\nmust leave home\\r\\n\\r\\nI must she said Better anything however horrid it may sound\\r\\nIf I do not get away from home I shall never be able to speak to\\r\\nanyone\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a long silence while she watched Richard Sotheby wrinkling up\\r\\nhis nose\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may be more unhappy when you can speak Anne Particularly if you\\r\\nshould fall in love That makes one more unhappy than anything else\\r\\nHowever you would do better to go as an English governess in a French\\r\\nfamily In that way you would see new people and have quite fresh\\r\\nexperiences\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Richard Sotheby began to speak of Paris while Anne sat fascinated\\r\\nby the magic flow of words seeing pictures of a great town full of\\r\\navenues and open spaces with a twisting river crossed by innumerable\\r\\nbridges And for some reason though she knew that Paris was a huge\\r\\ncity and though Richard spoke often of the crowds thronging the\\r\\nboulevards she imagined Paris as a willowpattern plate its bridges\\r\\nlike that steep bridge over which a blue figure is hurrying with\\r\\nbaldheaded Chinamen fishing in the winding river beside it on which\\r\\na barge is floating a lady is disembarking and weeping willow trees\\r\\nborder the Elysian fields\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voice went on Anne watching the fine forehead and the abstracted\\r\\neyes gazing into the fire was carried away by her imagination and saw\\r\\nherself living in the willowpattern city\\r\\n\\r\\nThat will be wonderful she said But what am I to say in my letter\\r\\nto Mrs Crowlink\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke in a tone of such despair that he burst out laughing at her\\r\\nYou are a child he said but his voice was too pleasant for her to\\r\\ntake offence and for the first time she knew the sweetness of being\\r\\nlaughed at without minding it I feel sure of his sympathy she said\\r\\nto herself Though I came here believing that I disliked him and even\\r\\nnow I am not sure what I think of him\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Sotheby had gathered his brushes together and was pouring\\r\\nwater from the kettle on to the ashes\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will come and sit to me tomorrow wont you he asked And then\\r\\nwe can go on with our discussion of your future Come at halfpast two\\r\\nbut now we had better go home separately otherwise we shall see our\\r\\nnames written up on Lamberts Barn Richard Sotheby loves Anne Dunnock\\r\\nand takes her to the Burnt Farm I wonder if they would put the dirty\\r\\ndog or bless his heart after my name It is usually one or the\\r\\nother\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne laughed at this and looked the grocers son in the eyes but his\\r\\nglance was one of mere amusement\\r\\n\\r\\nOh they would put the dirty dog after your name she said suddenly\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are quite right he said laughing Wonderful you should guess\\r\\nHe did not offer to shake hands and she walked away\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had read the scrawls chronicling the loves of the village boys and\\r\\ngirls but she had never thought that it would be possible to speak\\r\\nof them As she hurried home her heart was beating fast she looked\\r\\nneither to left nor right but kept repeating to herself Richard\\r\\nSotheby loves Anne Dunnock the dirty dog But he doesnt she\\r\\nadded wondering if she would wish to be loved by him\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she repeated as a variation Richard Sotheby doesnt love Anne\\r\\nDunnock the dirty dog That was more like the truth And she thought\\r\\nof the telegram she had seen him write and wondered if he would\\r\\ntell her about La Grandison Perhaps one day soon she would see her\\r\\nalighting from a barge in the Seine that ran through a willowpattern\\r\\nParis\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no other answers to her advertisement and as soon as the\\r\\nlying letter to Mrs Crowlink had been posted Anne was free to forget\\r\\nher problems The week which followed passed happily enough every\\r\\nafternoon she sat for an hour or more in the spring sunlight talking to\\r\\nRichard Sotheby while he painted her answering his questions about her\\r\\nchildhood at Ely describing the poverty in which they had lived and\\r\\nhow her mother had been looked down upon by the ladies of the cathedral\\r\\nset then telling him of her fathers eccentricities and his violent\\r\\ntemper and of the last outburst when he had insulted a canon and had\\r\\nbeen sent for by the Bishop and of how he had been kept to lunch at\\r\\nthe palace and sent away with the words I think you will do better by\\r\\nyourself Mr Dunnock There is a living going begging at Dry Coulter\\r\\nA hundred and twenty pounds a year\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pigeons cooed through all the afternoon the pear tree burst into\\r\\nflower over her head and was filled with the hum of hundreds of bees\\r\\nworking among the scarlet stamens at intervals Anne spoke of her life\\r\\nand every now and then Richard would interrupt her with questions\\r\\nabout her father When she told of his love for the birds Richard was\\r\\ndelighted and the rest of the afternoon was spent describing all his\\r\\nlittle acts of tenderness and consideration scattering straw for the\\r\\nsparrows to build their nests sowing teazles for the goldfinches\\r\\n\\r\\nI see that I should get on much better with your father than you do\\r\\nhe said We should have a great deal in common\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has made me hate birds said Anne Sometimes I think I should\\r\\nlike to wear a bird in my hat\\r\\n\\r\\nYou feel about birds what I feel about love and about religion I\\r\\nsuppose said Richard\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father has got birds and religion all mixed up somehow said\\r\\nAnne but when he asked her to explain all she could say was I dont\\r\\nunderstand it and I cant explain it but I know I am right It is\\r\\ndifficult to tell often of which he is speaking\\r\\n\\r\\nThat seems rather a beautiful confusion to me said Richard Just\\r\\nlisten for a moment to the pigeons in the dove house and you will feel\\r\\ninclined to it yourself\\r\\n\\r\\nI only hate them because I am wicked and selfish said Anne I am\\r\\nnot going to sacrifice all my life to beautiful things Father can only\\r\\nsee beauty in a chaffinch or a wagtail I might be beautiful too but\\r\\nhe would never notice it\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard laughed at this outburst As pretty as a wagtail he mused\\r\\nscrewing up his eyes and teasing her That is flying rather high\\r\\nisnt it\\r\\n\\r\\nI dont see why a human being shouldnt be as beautiful as a bird\\r\\nsaid Anne seriously at which her companion laughed more than ever\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps not he said Still you dont really hope that anyone should\\r\\never say to you Miss Dunnock you are as pretty as a hedgesparrow\\r\\nI of course with my long nose am rather like a snipe Then\\r\\nchanging his tone he went on You are more like a heron than a\\r\\nhedgesparrow a tall ghostly figure seen by moonlight standing in the\\r\\nreeds at the waters edge The herons hair is always flying loose like\\r\\nyours he tries in vain to keep it up with fish bones\\r\\n\\r\\nI am going to cut all my hair off cried Anne savagely\\r\\n\\r\\nYes I think you would look better said Richard simply But you\\r\\nmust not do that until my picture is finished Seriously if you want\\r\\nadmiration you should come to Paris You are quite sure to find\\r\\nsomeone there who will think you are beautiful\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bit her lip and asked herself if Richard could have told her more\\r\\nplainly to her face that he did not think so\\r\\n\\r\\nHe does not care for me she said to herself as she walked home the\\r\\nfollowing afternoon after the last sitting Had he cared for me he\\r\\nwould have said something nice to me when he said goodbye He is only\\r\\namused and contemptuous Thank Heaven I did not show him any of my\\r\\ndrawings\\r\\n\\r\\nFor she had taken out her drawing book that morning to try her hand\\r\\nat fashion plates and had sat a long while examining her old careful\\r\\nsketches of a deadnettle in flower and a spray of honeysuckle in bud\\r\\nonly to put them away at last guessing that her work would not make\\r\\nRichard Sotheby take her any more seriously though an ambition to earn\\r\\nher living by drawing clothes was still present in her mind\\r\\n\\r\\nYet he likes me I am sure of that she said He would not tease me\\r\\notherwise The thought consoled her and she crossed the green more\\r\\nhappily Suddenly she heard a little cry behind her a sharp note like\\r\\nthe clink of flint on steel and looking round she saw Rachel\\r\\n\\r\\nWill you come to tea tomorrow the child asked when she had\\r\\novertaken her It is my birthday and mother told me I might ask anyone\\r\\nthat I liked\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNINE BIRTHDAY TEA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne sat down to tea on the following afternoon with the four\\r\\nSothebys round an iced cake with thirteen candles in the rather\\r\\ndark little room where she had retired to hide her tears after Plough\\r\\nMonday darker now for it was raining outside There were chocolate\\r\\nbiscuits in glass dishes and crackers lying on the table between the\\r\\nplates But in spite of the air of jollity and of Rachels excitement\\r\\nAnne felt just as she had done on the first occasion she had entered\\r\\nthe room anxious to escape\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel had met her at the door they had kissed and she had given\\r\\nthe little girl a pair of furlined slippers as a birthday present\\r\\nbut immediately afterwards Mrs Sotheby had begun to introduce her\\r\\nto Richard and he had no sooner cut his mother short by saying that\\r\\nthey were acquainted already when the grocer came up and said Miss\\r\\nDunnock this is my son Richard of whom I think I have spoken to\\r\\nyou\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Dunnock and I have met said Richard and Anne added Richard\\r\\nand I are old friends already but at once became aware that what she\\r\\nsaid was the wrong thing for there was an expression of astonishment\\r\\nalmost of alarm possibly even of disapproval on Mr Sothebys face\\r\\nCertainly he seemed nervous as he said Well well since I find we\\r\\nare all acquainted let us sit down to tea\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difficulties of the introduction were forgotten in the excitement\\r\\nof cutting the cake and it was not long before the last of the\\r\\ncrackers was pulled a yellow paper crown was found for Mr Sotheby\\r\\nthere were paper caps for the rest of the company and though several\\r\\nof the mottoes alluded to Christmas they were read aloud with pleasure\\r\\nand received with delight\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is too bad Richard said Mr Sotheby over his third cup of tea\\r\\nYou are going away the day after tomorrow and you have never painted\\r\\nthe portrait of your mother for which I have asked so often\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne felt numb on hearing that Richard was going away in two days\\r\\ntime Why didnt he tell me that she asked herself but without\\r\\nnoticing her look the grocer went on You have spent all your time out\\r\\nsketching the old manor house but you have not shown us any of your\\r\\nwork\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brought it back today said Mrs Sotheby But I havent seen\\r\\nit Richard was reluctant to show his picture but at last he left\\r\\nthe room and it was only then seeing Rachel was trembling and upset\\r\\nabout something that Anne suddenly remembered that the Sothebys might\\r\\neasily recognize the figure of the girl in the foreground engaged in\\r\\ndoing up her hair\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard lifted an eyebrow at her as he put the canvas on the\\r\\nmantelpiece and there was a long silence a silence which grew\\r\\nalarming and Anne knew that she had been recognized\\r\\n\\r\\nThis figure is you Miss Dunnock said the grocer at last speaking\\r\\nstiffly\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Dunnock came by while I was making tea for Richard said Rachel\\r\\nin her precise tone and everyone in the room breathed more freely\\r\\nShe stayed to tea with us\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she was good enough to pose for me while I drew a sketch of her to\\r\\nput into the foreground said Richard\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very kind of you to be sure said his father\\r\\n\\r\\nI think you ought to be ashamed of yourself Richard said Mrs\\r\\nSotheby Putting Miss Dunnock into your horrid picture like that you\\r\\nhavent done her justice at all I should scarcely have recognized\\r\\nher And the grocers wife gave Anne a little smile to tell her that\\r\\nshe did not mind Richards having painted her instead of the portrait\\r\\nthat his father wanted\\r\\n\\r\\nI should never have sat to him said Anne if I had known that he\\r\\nought to have been painting your portrait but Mr Sotheby was saying\\r\\nthat he had to be off on business\\r\\n\\r\\nVery very kind of you to come on Rachels birthday he said as he\\r\\nleft the room\\r\\n\\r\\nNo indeed there is hardly any resemblance at all said Mrs\\r\\nSotheby Anyone might think it was one of the Puttys come home again\\r\\n\\r\\nWho are the Puttys asked Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat you dont mean to say that you have never heard of the Puttys\\r\\nexclaimed Rachel and her mother together and Richard who had been\\r\\nlooking glum since he had shown his picture added Yes you ought to\\r\\nhear that story since you are the only other person that has turned\\r\\nthe ploughmen away\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can you say such a thing Richard said Mrs Sotheby You know\\r\\nhow that came about by mistake but Anne asked\\r\\n\\r\\nDid the Puttys have their doorstep ploughed up\\r\\n\\r\\nNo not the Puttys was the answer and as Anne seemed mystified but\\r\\neager to hear more Richard said Come mother tell Miss Dunnock the\\r\\nwhole story from the beginning And Rachel also added her request for\\r\\nthe story\\r\\n\\r\\nWell wait a moment till I have cleared away the teathings said\\r\\nMrs Sotheby work that was soon done with both Rachel and Anne\\r\\nhelping While they were out of the room Richard seized the opportunity\\r\\nto take his canvas off the mantelpiece He hid it in the woodshed and\\r\\ncame back feeling happier\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chairs were drawn up round the fire Rachel sitting at Annes knee\\r\\nand holding her hand and Mrs Sotheby began\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat you children call the Burnt Farm is really the ruins of a manor\\r\\nhouse the squire lived there Captain Purdue and since the burning\\r\\nthere has been no squire at Dry Coulter I can remember him very well\\r\\na tall man who had been a captain in the navy and he certainly thought\\r\\na great deal about appearances One could tell that just by looking at\\r\\nhim what one could not have told was that he cared a great deal about\\r\\nmoney too\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have forgotten to say that he had been dismissed the service\\r\\nRichard reminded his mother\\r\\n\\r\\nWell his ship was wrecked you know and he left the navy after that\\r\\nI have heard that he was turned out because of it but I do not really\\r\\nknow said Mrs Sotheby Certainly he was a very unlucky man but at\\r\\nfirst all went well he had a fine house built in the time of King\\r\\nCharles II Olivers men had burnt the old house down in the civil\\r\\nwars and a wonderful garden he had a whole greenhouse full of arum\\r\\nlilies in the winter his horses were famous and his dairy cows won\\r\\nprizes At that time there was not a gentlemans place for miles round\\r\\nthat was kept up better But I should have said that Captain Purdue\\r\\nwas married to a very goodlooking lady indeed She was a good deal\\r\\nyounger than he was and I think she came from the Channel Islands But\\r\\nthey had no children\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was the jangle of the shop bell Mrs Sotheby broke off her\\r\\nsentence and started to her feet but Rachel had slipped out into the\\r\\nshop before her and they could hear a woman saying that she had just\\r\\nrun across for a bar of soap and then when she had made her purchase\\r\\nask It is your birthday isnt it Rachel Many happy returns\\r\\nHow does it feel to be grown up and the little girl answer Very\\r\\npleasant indeed thank you very much Mrs Papworth\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of the Captains misfortunes continued Mrs Sotheby was\\r\\nthat his wife ran away from him and it was not long after that before\\r\\nhe was killed in an accident He was having his barn altered it was\\r\\nan old building nearly as old as the house and he wanted to make it\\r\\na couple of feet higher and was having the roof raised on jacks They\\r\\ngot one side of it up some inches and then the foreman sent for him to\\r\\ntell him that it couldnt be done The Captain went to see for himself\\r\\nbut he would not listen to anything the men said but gave the word to\\r\\ngo on with the work and they had not given the screws on the other\\r\\nside half a dozen turns before the main beam broke in two and the whole\\r\\nroof fell in on them Captain Purdue was standing just underneath and\\r\\nwas killed and three of the men were badly injured You see it was no\\r\\nones fault but his own and indeed it was very lucky that others were\\r\\nnot killed beside himself\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how did the house get burnt and what had the ploughmen to do with\\r\\nit asked Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing at all answered Mrs Sotheby with a laugh But some of the\\r\\nmost ignorant of the men said that his bad luck was because they had\\r\\nploughed the doorstep up Thats why it was so wrong of them to behave\\r\\nlike that to your father if they really believe what they say But I\\r\\ndont think they do believe such things nowadays everyone laughs at\\r\\nthem but I think people will do anything if it is the custom\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they are expecting us to have bad luck asked Anne with her face\\r\\nsuddenly serious\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard looked at her rather maliciously and laughed\\r\\n\\r\\nYes we all expect you to run away from home and your father to fall\\r\\nout of a tree and break his neck while he is putting a young bird back\\r\\ninto its nest\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard laughed at this while his mother exclaimed How dare you talk\\r\\nlike that Richard\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is only being a tease said Rachel looking up at Anne I have\\r\\ngot used to it now and pay no attention to him\\r\\n\\r\\nFinish the story mother said Richard and Anne added her voice to\\r\\nhis Please finish the story I am waiting to hear how the house was\\r\\nburnt down Then I shall go home and buy some fire extinguishers\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all laughed at this and Mrs Sotheby continued\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Captain Purdues death it was nearly a year before the lawyers\\r\\ncould find the heirs to the estate and when they did find them the\\r\\ntrouble was to know what to do with them They called themselves Putty\\r\\nthough the name was really Purdue the father and mother were dead and\\r\\nthere were two brothers and two sisters They had lived all their lives\\r\\nin a tumbledown cottage without proper windows or doors right out on\\r\\nthe Bedford Level miles from anywhere The brothers were labourers\\r\\nditchers The elder of the two was called Jack he was the best of the\\r\\nfamily but it was difficult to make out what he said There was no\\r\\ngetting anything out of his brother he was stone deaf and had a cleft\\r\\npalate The girls were very wild dirty creatures and not quite right\\r\\nin the head When they were sober they were all like wooden images\\r\\nand they looked very queer when they first came in the black clothes\\r\\nMr Stott had bought for them Well they moved into the house and\\r\\nwithin a week all the servants left and they were alone there None of\\r\\nthe gentry round would have anything to do with them nobody went near\\r\\nthe house except Dr Boulder and Mr Noble who was the vicar here in\\r\\nthose days and of course Mr Stott the lawyer At first they lived\\r\\nvery quietly only making a fearful mess of the three rooms they used\\r\\nThey were afraid that Mr Stott could turn them out if he had wanted\\r\\nto but after they had been there two or three months they grew more\\r\\nconfident And though they were like images if there were other people\\r\\nabout there was plenty of noise when they were by themselves and when\\r\\nthey were drunk Jack used to throw things and his sisters would throw\\r\\nthings back At first they came to The Red Cow for drink and Jack\\r\\nused sometimes to wave Captain Purdues hunting crop and threaten to\\r\\nhorsewhip anybody who didnt take his hat off and one day when he had\\r\\ngot very drunk he stood by the monument on the green and made a speech\\r\\nPeople could hear him bellowing for miles round but no one could make\\r\\nout much of what he said except that he was the squire and that he\\r\\nought to have been told before and that he would never be rough with\\r\\nanybody\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day when he was in The Red Cow one of the men asked him how it\\r\\nwas that he didnt like port wine That was the first Jack had heard\\r\\nof Captain Purdues cellar for would you believe it the Puttys had\\r\\nnever been all over the house and the cellar being locked up they had\\r\\nnot troubled to break it open After they found the wine nothing was\\r\\nseen of them for more than a week and then one night we were all\\r\\nwoken up with the news that the manor house had caught fire Everyone\\r\\nin the village turned out to help and the fire engine was fetched from\\r\\nLinton but it came too late to be any use The whole house was ablaze\\r\\nwhen we got there the dairy and stables too for they were touching\\r\\nthe house The men had made a line from the pond and were passing\\r\\nbuckets but it did no good for the rooms were very oldfashioned and\\r\\nall the panelling had caught alight by that time and the staircase\\r\\ntoo The flames made it as light as day\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about the Puttys asked Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nWell that was a very dreadful story Jack Putty had just broken his\\r\\nway out of the house when we got there but the two girls and the\\r\\ndeaf brother were still inside One of the Peck boys who went to Wet\\r\\nCoulter afterwards as a ploughman got out both of the girls but they\\r\\nwere terribly burned and the brother lost his life Jack Putty did not\\r\\nseem to understand what was happening at first but when the fire had\\r\\ntaken hold of everything he missed his brother and then he ran back\\r\\ninto the house to find him He came out again with his clothes alight\\r\\nand jumped into the pond and then when he got out he ran back into\\r\\nthe fire again It was dreadful to see that He got out alive a second\\r\\ntime and would have gone in a third time but everyone could see it\\r\\nwas no use and they prevented him it took four men to hold him Poor\\r\\nfellow his feet were terribly burned but he didnt seem to mind\\r\\nthat but kept crying out that he must save his brother\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that they were all taken to the hospital and there they found\\r\\nout that the girls were not fit to be about so they were sent to an\\r\\nasylum for the imbecile They have been there ever since but Jack\\r\\nPutty seemed a different man after that He went out to Australia Mr\\r\\nStott sends him his rent regularly and Jack sent him word when he got\\r\\nmarried The property still belongs to him of course and that is how\\r\\nit is that the manor house has never been rebuilt\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a silence in the little parlour while they turned the story\\r\\nover in their minds Mrs Sotheby began to poke up the fire in the\\r\\ngrate and the flames shot up they had been sitting almost in the dark\\r\\n\\r\\nA wonderful story said Richard I often think of Jack Putty as a\\r\\nmodel a man who was really able to love his brother as himself That\\r\\nis the only sort of love love which will sacrifice everything put up\\r\\nwith everything yet ask for nothing in return Selfish love is misery\\r\\nI suppose it deserves to be but how does one avoid it\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy do you think Jack Putty felt unselfish love Anne asked feeling\\r\\nrather puzzled\\r\\n\\r\\nYou dont think he tried to go back into the fire for the third time\\r\\nbecause it was gentlemanly do you though Ive no doubt he really was\\r\\na gentleman answered Richard\\r\\n\\r\\nYou would not have thought Jack Putty was a gentleman if you had seen\\r\\nhim said his mother\\r\\n\\r\\nI daresay not but I should have been wrong  he was fearless and\\r\\nhe was independent said Richard\\r\\n\\r\\nHe certainly was not a biddable man said Mrs Sotheby But that was\\r\\nthe only thing he had in common with his second cousin Captain Purdue\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Peck boy went in once to rescue the two girls but I should\\r\\nnot have gone in at all I dont think I should go into a burning\\r\\nhouse even if you or Rachel were inside it Im sure if Ginette \\r\\nGrandison But its not a proof of love at all some people will\\r\\nrisk their lives to save a kitten He muttered something else but the\\r\\nothers could not catch it\\r\\n\\r\\nI must be going said Anne getting up Gracious me it is past six\\r\\noclock And thanking Mrs Sotheby for her story and kissing Rachel\\r\\nshe hurried back through the rain to the vicarage to prepare supper\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTEN NO GOODBYES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was morning before Anne could find any sleep and the hours she\\r\\nspent lying in the darkness with her eyes open or sometimes standing\\r\\nat her bedroom window gazing out at the pale lawn and the moony spaces\\r\\nof the orchard beyond listening to the whispering notes of the little\\r\\nowls and to the weathervane on the dove house whimpering as it\\r\\nswung in the wind those hours were remembered afterwards as the most\\r\\nmiserable of her life\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat have I done she asked herself but she could find nothing in\\r\\nher own conduct to explain Richards behaviour If he regarded me with\\r\\neven the interest of a casual acquaintance he must have told me of his\\r\\ndeparture He would have said something surely Even if he hates me he\\r\\nwould have spoken of when he was going away\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Richard had not mentioned it and had it not been for a chance\\r\\nremark of Mr Sothebys she would have known nothing of the matter He\\r\\nmust have intended to hide it from me she said wondering why it\\r\\nshould be hidden and asking herself if it was because he was afraid of\\r\\ntelling her or because he had fancied that she was in love with him\\r\\n\\r\\nNo he has no such thoughts she assured herself It is because of\\r\\nhis complete indifference to me His whole mind is occupied by Ginette\\r\\nGrandison And suddenly a new thought striking her she said aloud\\r\\nand almost joyfully Who knows what unhappiness she may be causing\\r\\nhim The thought of Richards pain was a comfort to her and she\\r\\nwondered once more what the woman could be like who had so enslaved him\\r\\n\\r\\nI seem sometimes in my thoughts to assume that I am in love with\\r\\nRichard myself she said to herself with surprise But indeed I dont\\r\\nlove him He is hateful when I am with him I know well enough that we\\r\\ncould never by any chance love each other He is as sharp as his own\\r\\nnose he has no feelings that I can understand But yet I am fond of\\r\\nhim for he is the first man to whom I have been able to speak freely\\r\\nthe first man How I long to live in a world of such men To live in\\r\\nParis\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently her thoughts turned from Richard and his cruel behaviour to\\r\\nthink of her own life and what it would become\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have escaped from here by now had it not been for him she\\r\\nsaid bitterly and then recollecting that there had been no more\\r\\nanswers to her advertisement she wondered if she would ever have\\r\\nanother opportunity If I have the courage to advertise again she\\r\\nadded for even that seemed doubtful to her at that hour\\r\\n\\r\\nDamn the fellow she said at last He has disturbed my life to no\\r\\npurpose he has raised a hundred questions he cannot answer I should\\r\\nhave been happier if I had never seen him\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it seemed to her that every fresh experience in life would always\\r\\nbring her such regrets that all struggles were only destined to make\\r\\nher suffer and that the best course perhaps was to go through life\\r\\nblindly living from day to day immersed in a world of dreams like her\\r\\nfather and like him shunning all contact with her fellow creatures\\r\\nThese thoughts were dreadful to her for the afternoons she had passed\\r\\nsitting at the Burnt Farm talking to Richard Sotheby while he painted\\r\\nher were precious The happiest moments in my life she cried For I\\r\\nthought then that I had found a friend\\r\\n\\r\\nYet it was true she would have been happier if she had never met him\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not jealous she exclaimed I know he is in love with Ginette\\r\\nGrandison I have always known it and it has never given me a\\r\\nmoments pang of jealousy If only he had spoken of her if he had told\\r\\nme he was going back to her I should have felt happy for his sake I\\r\\nshould not have had a single selfish thought\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he has made me lay bare my whole life to him and has never once\\r\\nspoken of his own I only know of the existence of Ginette Grandison by\\r\\nan accident he would not trust me with his secret and would be annoyed\\r\\nat my knowing it No friendship can be based on anything so onesided\\r\\nas our conversations have been And the reason is plain only that I\\r\\nhave been too stupid to see it before The reason is that he never\\r\\nintended a friendship It amused him to get my little secret from me\\r\\nit flattered his\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Anne suddenly checked her thought crying No that is vulgar\\r\\nthat is unworthy The root of the matter is that I mean nothing to\\r\\nhim nothing whilst to me he is the only man with whom I have spoken\\r\\nfreely the only intimate friend except Enid that I have ever had And\\r\\nhe cares no more for me than she did\\r\\n\\r\\nA flood of tears eased her heart she turned her face to the pillow\\r\\nthen when she had done weeping she got out of bed once more and went\\r\\nto the window The air was cold there was a gust of wind in the\\r\\nchimney the weathercock gave its gentle whine\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter standing there an hour Anne went back to bed again with a\\r\\npicture of the darkness in her mind saying to herself And so on for\\r\\never and ever cold and darkness after the sunshine and the warmth of\\r\\nthe day\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning Anne felt ill when she woke her head ached she was\\r\\ndizzy and the outer world was seen alternately as a whirling mist and\\r\\ndefined with extraordinary clearness She got up from habit but she\\r\\ncould eat nothing at breakfast and as soon as her bed had been made\\r\\nshe undressed and lay down on it and fell asleep\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she awoke it was with the echo of Richards voice ringing in her\\r\\nears she scrambled out of bed and went at once to her window There\\r\\nwas nothing to be seen she blinked her eyes in the brilliant sunlight\\r\\nand reeling with sleep groped her way back through the sudden\\r\\ndarkness of the room to her bed to fall into a doze from which she\\r\\nawoke once more this time with the certainty of having heard voices\\r\\nbeyond a doubt one of them was Richards\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voices rose for a moment then she heard the front door slam in a\\r\\ngust of wind and there was a silence She understood suddenly that\\r\\nRichard had been in the house that he had come to see her and she got\\r\\nout of bed\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bedroom window gave on to the garden so she ran to her fathers\\r\\nroom just as she had done to see the ploughmen on that snowy winter\\r\\nmorning Her guess had been right for there almost directly beneath\\r\\nher were Richard and her father they were standing bareheaded in the\\r\\nrain talking amicably she could hear her fathers gentle laugh they\\r\\nwere reluctant to part Annes first instinct was to call out to ask\\r\\nRichard to wait while she exchanged her dressinggown for clothes in\\r\\nwhich she could appear but she realized that it was impossible to\\r\\ndo so and then with the angry feelings that every sick person has\\r\\nexperienced of knowing that life is going on unchanged behind his back\\r\\nshe was forced to watch Richard disappear after shaking hands with her\\r\\nfather by the garden gate\\r\\n\\r\\nA thousand pities she said to herself He must have come to see me\\r\\nWhat can he have said to my father Her headache and dizziness were\\r\\ngone she felt eager and excited and the moments while she was putting\\r\\non her clothes and doing up her hair were spent in trying to imagine\\r\\nthe conversation that had been going on while she was asleep\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat an extraordinary thing said Anne that he should think of\\r\\ncalling Nobody but Richard would have done such a thing Her thoughts\\r\\nwere interrupted by Maggie coming to ask her if she would like to have\\r\\ntea in bed As she was going downstairs it occurred to her that Richard\\r\\nmight have spoken of her he would have told her father that they had\\r\\nmet he might even have mentioned his picture As she opened the door\\r\\ninto the room where her father was already sitting she remembered\\r\\nthe wellbroughtup heroes in Victorian novels who ask a fathers\\r\\npermission before entering into correspondence with the girl they have\\r\\nrescued when the pony has taken the bit between its teeth and the\\r\\ngoverness cart is heading for the side of the quarry  a memory which\\r\\nwas driven away with a laugh but which left her anxious and expectant\\r\\nas she took her place at the tea table\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Dunnock did not make any reference to his visitor though he\\r\\nwas less abstracted than usual asking Anne with great solicitude\\r\\nabout her headache and then saying I have been feeling a little\\r\\nmore melancholy than usual today because of the bad weather and\\r\\nso I took down Burton In his anatomy he has much to say about the\\r\\neffect of food The authorities all agree that beef is only safe for\\r\\nthose who lead an active life that pork is definitely bad for the\\r\\nreasoning man that goats flesh disposes those who partake of it to\\r\\nevilliving venison is most strongly condemned and even horseflesh\\r\\nis held to account for the wellknown melancholy of your Spaniard\\r\\namong vegetables the onion and its congeners and I am glad to say the\\r\\ncabbage are absolutely condemned peas and beans should be avoided\\r\\nas far as possible and salads and fruit only taken in the strictest\\r\\nmoderation Burton thinks that the potato may be a safe article of\\r\\ndiet and highly recommends borage\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne was smiling at her fathers enthusiasm There seems very little\\r\\nfor you to eat she said\\r\\n\\r\\nWell Anne I do not know quite what Burton would recommend he says\\r\\nnothing against wheaten bread he regards fresh country cheese as\\r\\nwholesome and speaks with enthusiasm of beer Mr Dunnock giggled as\\r\\nhe said this and for some reason that familiar clerical sound seemed\\r\\nto his daughter at that moment to express all that she most hated and\\r\\ndespised The giggle is unforgivable she said to herself gazing\\r\\nat her father over the tea table He is a grownup man he has a\\r\\nbeard he is my father but if beer is mentioned one hears a silly\\r\\nadolescent giggle One would think that he was a choir boy caught with\\r\\na cigarette\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left the table and went out into the garden in a fury she had\\r\\nforgotten her own embarrassment when Richard had used the word rape\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Dunnock absorbed in his own thoughts hardly looked after her\\r\\n\\r\\nBeer he said pouring himself out a fourth cup of tea and giggling\\r\\nslightly Good stuff beer He thought that because his name was\\r\\nBurton and Mr Dunnock began to wonder if Robert Burton had really\\r\\ncome from BurtononTrent and if beer had always been brewed there\\r\\n\\r\\nI forgot to tell you he said to Anne at supper that I had a visit\\r\\nthis afternoon from Richard Sotheby the son of our grocer It was a\\r\\ngreat pity that you had a headache for we do not have many interesting\\r\\nvisitors I think he is charming a most delightful most intelligent\\r\\nyoung man But you should have told me that you had met him you should\\r\\nhave asked him to tea and have introduced him to me It was too bad\\r\\nAnne to have kept him to yourself\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne gasped with astonishment and not knowing what to reply waited\\r\\nuntil her father went on He seems to have liked you very much you\\r\\nhave made quite a conquest and Mr Dunnock smiled his peculiar little\\r\\nsmile which showed that he was not speaking seriously\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought you rather disapproved of the Sothebys said Anne\\r\\nBecause of course they are Nonconformists\\r\\n\\r\\nWell well said her father wrinkling up his face at the word for\\r\\nit set his teeth on edge like the thought of sour fruit Well well I\\r\\nsuppose they are happy with their little ugly worship I confess their\\r\\noutlook is repugnant to me But the son has escaped from all that He\\r\\ntold me he has been to visit Little Gidding and asked me a number of\\r\\nquestions about Nicholas Ferrars community Apparently he is greatly\\r\\ninterested in the antiquities of the county\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne had known Little Gidding all her life and she shared her fathers\\r\\nlove for the lonely little church perched on the edge of the hillside\\r\\nwith the slope of green sward below and the woods behind She had been\\r\\nbrought up to revere Nicholas Ferrar and had loved to reconstruct a\\r\\nlife which had so much of the beauty of religion in it and nothing\\r\\nof what she disliked Often she thought that she would have been\\r\\ncontent for her father to have been a clergyman if he had lived in the\\r\\nseventeenth century or even in the eighteenth for the matter of that\\r\\nfor it was only during the reign of Queen Victoria that the clergy in\\r\\nEngland lost touch with the community and became selfconscious Anne\\r\\nknew how much happier her father would have been had he belonged to\\r\\nNicholas Ferrars household and though she would not have cared for\\r\\nit herself she would have disliked rising at four oclock for prayers\\r\\nevery morning she wished he could live in such a way himself Thus for\\r\\nonce she was tolerant for she loved Little Gidding and had prayed in\\r\\nthe narrow little church with an outburst of religious passion such as\\r\\nshe had never experienced in Ely Cathedral\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the rest of that evening father and daughter spoke of Little\\r\\nGidding calling up pictures in each others minds of how it must be\\r\\nlooking in the spring weather and of the life of the immense and\\r\\nextraordinary household which had lived there until the Roundheads had\\r\\nburned the roof over their heads and had thrown the brass eagle lectern\\r\\nin the church into the pond below\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men slept in one wing of the house and the women in the other\\r\\nAnne remembered And Nicholas Ferrar slept watchfully in the middle\\r\\nThat is the funny side but she hid her thought from her father and\\r\\nwhen she spoke it was to remind him of the immense number of children\\r\\nin the community\\r\\n\\r\\nHis daughter brought her eleven children there were thirty people\\r\\naltogether said her father and he passed on to describe the three\\r\\nvisits of King Charles I and so vivid were his words that Anne could\\r\\npicture to herself more clearly than ever before the visit the King\\r\\npaid during the civil war when he came toiling up the hill on foot and\\r\\nalone to pray\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no more sacred spot in England said Mr Dunnock and Anne\\r\\nwas inclined to agree with him That night she lay for some time\\r\\nwithout sleeping giving herself up to the happiest thoughts and\\r\\nwhen at last she dozed off it was with the picture of Richard Sotheby\\r\\nin her mind Richard walking over the greenest turf where the manor\\r\\nhouse had stood resting on the sides of the dry grassy moat and then\\r\\nwalking down by the edge of the wood to the little church with Nicholas\\r\\nFerrars tomb in the pathway leading up to it under a tombstone the\\r\\nletters of which are written in moss A tall figure came toiling up the\\r\\nhill to meet him she saw a tired man with a pale faceKing Charles\\r\\nthe First and try how she would to dream of Richard Sotheby King\\r\\nCharles would reappear\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall certainly try to see Richard before he goes this morning\\r\\nAnne thought at breakfast I shall look in and tell Mrs Sotheby that\\r\\nI have come to say goodbye\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the time came she went past the shop for she remembered Mr\\r\\nSothebys look of surprise when he found that she was acquainted with\\r\\nhis son and the long hostile silence before he spoke after he had\\r\\nrecognized her in the painting\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Sotheby does not approve of my knowing Richard Anne said to\\r\\nherself glancing through the windows of the shop She could see no\\r\\none inside and the longer she meditated over the grocers behaviour\\r\\nat Rachels birthday party the more convinced she became that he was\\r\\njealous of her and alarmed lest an attachment should spring up between\\r\\nhis son and her\\r\\n\\r\\nI will go for a stroll on the green and looking about her she saw\\r\\nfor the first time that the sun was shining and that the grass was\\r\\ngreener after the rain of the day before Why the hawthorns have come\\r\\ninto leaf the horsechestnut buds are bursting in a few days the\\r\\napples will be in blossom but the daily progress of the spring which\\r\\nwould ordinarily have given her such keen pleasure was meaningless\\r\\nnow I must see Richard before he goes she said in desperation\\r\\nI must arrange with him about finding me work in Paris and she\\r\\nremembered with dismay that she did not even know his address\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon she turned back on her footsteps and fully an hour was spent in\\r\\npassing and repassing the grocers shop\\r\\n\\r\\nI am wasting my time she thought For Easter is nearly upon us\\r\\nthere is much to do at the church But it was not possible to go\\r\\nhome after waiting so long and at last she set off along the road to\\r\\nLinton A mile was covered before it occurred to her that Richard would\\r\\nbe driving with his father and that even if Mr Sotheby should pull up\\r\\nit would be difficult for them to speak in front of him and she turned\\r\\nback and walked to the village at top speed\\r\\n\\r\\nAll seemed well for she had not passed them on the road and she\\r\\ndetermined once more to enter the shop but it occurred to her as she\\r\\napproached that Rachel would be coming out of school in a few minutes\\r\\nit was just twelve oclock\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she turned the corner by the schoolhouse she noticed the strange\\r\\nring deeply cut into the earth and full of dust and wondered again\\r\\nwhat game the children played there\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the door opened and the children began to run out In this riot I\\r\\nshall not be able to speak to Rachel Anne said to herself But if I\\r\\nwalk back towards the shop she may walk another way\\r\\n\\r\\nA lovely morning Miss Dunnock said a voice behind her and she\\r\\nturned to find Mr Lambert\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moments spent talking to him were agonizing for every instant\\r\\nshe expected to see Rachel run past her but Mr Lambert would not be\\r\\nhurried Soon he began to speak of Easter and the arrangements at the\\r\\nchurch for he was a churchwarden and when that subject was exhausted\\r\\nhe returned to the weather\\r\\n\\r\\nOne is happy to be alive on such a morning Miss Dunnock I envy you\\r\\nyour leisure to enjoy it Free as air Miss Dunnock and no one to call\\r\\nyour master Work is my master This weather keeps us very busy\\r\\n\\r\\nImpertinent puppy said Anne to herself though as a matter of fact\\r\\nshe rather liked Mr Lambert and saw nothing impertinent in his\\r\\nmanners\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the very moment when Mr Lambert released her she heard Rachels\\r\\nvoice saying Good morning Miss Dunnock and the little girl ran by\\r\\nher with two or three other children Anne saw that it was useless to\\r\\nwait any longer and returned to the vicarage there was nothing to be\\r\\nangry about nobody was at fault\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was this note left for you Rachel Sotheby brought it over\\r\\nsaid Maggie when she went into the kitchen and Anne thought the\\r\\ngirls grin was an impertinence too\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard had gone by the early morning train I am so sorry not to see\\r\\nyou to say goodbye he wrote You must not forget your promise to\\r\\nwrite and remember to tell me all the news of the parish He enclosed\\r\\nhis address\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nELEVEN BEFORE THE SWALLOW DARES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEaster was over but the church at Dry Coulter was still full of the\\r\\nscent of flowers mingled with the odour of their corruption A necklace\\r\\nof decayed marshmallows hung forlornly round the neck of the eagle\\r\\nits brazen beak held a bunch of wilted cowslips but the daffodils and\\r\\nnarcissus on the altar still breathed out their perfume Easter was\\r\\nover and Mr Dunnock heaved a sigh of relief for he had come to feel\\r\\nthe church festivals a great strain upon him\\r\\n\\r\\nEaster was over Mrs Pattle marched up the aisle on her flat feet and\\r\\nbegan tearing down the flowers which her children had gathered three\\r\\ndays before\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Dunnock walked by the little pathway from the vestry to his wifes\\r\\ngrave and stood there looking at the headstone He stayed there so\\r\\nlong and stood so still that a robin recognizing a friend in him came\\r\\nto perch on his shoulder\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resurrection of the flesh has come to pass Mr Dunnock said\\r\\naloud These ones come to me and they commune with me why does she\\r\\nalone delay\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last a cow lowing on the other side of the hedge interrupted the\\r\\nclergymans reverie he started slightly and coming to himself began\\r\\nto pull his beard with a gesture of despair and the robin who had\\r\\nbeen wondering if he could induce his wife to nest in it flew off to a\\r\\ntombstone disappointed\\r\\n\\r\\nI live in two worlds Mr Dunnock reflected Only the saints know\\r\\nhow terrible the strain of such an experience can be I cannot bear\\r\\nit much longer something will break in me My head aches when I am\\r\\nrecalled from the contemplation of so much glory to the pettiness in\\r\\nwhich men live their eyes on the ground and their ears stopped to\\r\\nthe voices of the angels I cannot endure it any longer it would be\\r\\nbetter I think if I were to live alone He clutched at his head\\r\\nsuddenly and then walked rapidly from the churchyard towards the\\r\\nvicarage But the song of a willow wren caught his ear as he passed\\r\\nunder the elms and he paused to listen The clear top note was\\r\\nfollowed by a stream of softer sounds and ended with a cadence of lower\\r\\nnotes a touch of melancholy in which the vicar felt his own heart\\r\\nexpressed The bird sang and sang again and Mr Dunnock resting his\\r\\nshoulder against the rough bark of an elm listened without seeing the\\r\\napproach of two village women or noticing their inquisitive glances\\r\\nas they passed near him or hearing their words for in answer to a\\r\\nnudge one of them had protested to her companion Oh dear me Fanny\\r\\nDont\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were silent for fear of laughing but when they had passed the\\r\\nvicar one of them said Maggie told me she couldnt make anything of\\r\\nhis sermon on Easter Sunday It was all about Easter Eggs being the\\r\\npromise of glory She didnt know what he meant by it\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the women did not laugh and soon turned to safer and more\\r\\ninteresting topics of conversation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe willow wren had been silent a long while and was looking for\\r\\nworms when at last for Mr Dunnock also the mood of ecstasy passed\\r\\nhe looked about him startled and bewildered and then reassured by\\r\\nfinding he was alone he shook his head sadly and the first glance of\\r\\nfear was replaced by a bitter smile as he hurried back to the vicarage\\r\\nat top speed\\r\\n\\r\\nLay my meals on a tray in future he said to Maggie a few minutes\\r\\nlater And put the tray on the table in the passage outside my study\\r\\nI shall hear if you tap on the door Words which were repeated to\\r\\nAnne when she came down to lunch She was content to be alone but at\\r\\ndinner she was disturbed at this alteration in her fathers habits\\r\\nwondering whether he were unwell or whether by any chance Maggie were\\r\\nright in believing that he wished the change to be permanent But this\\r\\nseemed to her so unlikely a possibility that she did not dwell on it\\r\\nand when the meal was over she lit the lamp and settled down with\\r\\nher drawingboard in front of her she had at last begun the fashion\\r\\nplates which she had been projecting all the winter The fine weather\\r\\nhad returned after Richard Sothebys departure and for the first day\\r\\nof warm sunshine Anne had found happiness enough in being out of doors\\r\\na happiness shot through with irritation against herself\\r\\n\\r\\nI am wasting my life looking at this pear blossom What does it\\r\\nmatter to me whether the fruit set or not I shall be gone before the\\r\\ngathering But her habitual interest had been too strong for her and\\r\\nshe had watched the bees flying in and out among the masses of curdy\\r\\npetals with delight\\r\\n\\r\\nI am lingering on I shall linger all my life I must go now I must\\r\\nleave home today\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was impossible to leave on the day before Easter and instead\\r\\nof packing her box she had gone to the church to pin up the notice\\r\\nsaying There will be no service on Saturday when the church will be\\r\\nopen for decoration\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Saturday had come she had gone herself to help the little girls\\r\\nand it was not until after Easter was over that the fashion plates had\\r\\nbeen begun The results of her labours surpassed Annes expectations\\r\\nsuch fashion plates as hers she felt sure would excite the Parisian\\r\\ndressmakers\\r\\n\\r\\nI must send them to Richard at once she said as she took out the\\r\\ndrawingpins But the thought of waiting for a letter and the agony\\r\\nof uncertainty in which she saw herself dismayed her In her mood of\\r\\nexultation delay of any kind seemed impossible\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I will wait all the same she said until I have finished a\\r\\ndozen and then I shall go to Paris myself to seek my fortune I will\\r\\nwrite and tell Richard that I am coming\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter was put off she would not write until she knew the day and\\r\\nthe hour of her arrival and for several days she worked hard shutting\\r\\nherself up in her room every morning when the bed had been made When\\r\\nshe laid down her brush it was to plan how she would have her hair cut\\r\\noff in London and how she would buy herself a smart dress for the\\r\\njourney for she believed that she would never impress a dressmaker in\\r\\nsuch rags as she possessed With her mind full of such matters Anne\\r\\nrose and looked out of her window the first blush of pink petals was\\r\\nshowing through the early green of the apple trees in another week\\r\\nthey would be in full blossom Under the trees Mr Dunnock was standing\\r\\nwith his arms raised above his head gazing up at the sky a pose which\\r\\nAnne found sufficiently startling to make her look again carefully\\r\\nscreening her eyes from the sunlight Her father stood motionless\\r\\nevery little while she could see a small bird fly up and settle on his\\r\\nshoulder\\r\\n\\r\\nI have scarcely spoken to father for three days I must speak to him\\r\\nnow and tell him of my plans and as she made this resolution she\\r\\nsaw him moving slowly across the lawn As he came nearer she saw that\\r\\na crowd of little birds was following him a wild twittering came from\\r\\nthem they were mobbing him as though he were a cat or an owl at every\\r\\nmoment birds would settle on his head or shoulders or on his upraised\\r\\nhands and then would fly off again\\r\\n\\r\\nA beautiful spectacle it seemed to Anne and she felt a new tenderness\\r\\nfor her father as she watched The thin black figure with the head\\r\\nthrown back the eyes turned up and the beard jutting out no longer\\r\\nseemed queer as it had a moment before when she had first caught\\r\\nsight of it standing under the apple trees\\r\\n\\r\\nHe will feel my desertion she murmured a sudden sympathy with her\\r\\nfather coming to her and she felt a love which had been forgotten for\\r\\nmany months\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst mother and then me she said But her love did not weaken her\\r\\ndetermination to speak to him of her departure but strengthened it\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr Dunnock reached the house he shook his head first gently\\r\\nbut then as a bluetit still remained perched there more violently\\r\\nand then turning round waved his hands towards the birds which had\\r\\nsettled in the rose bushes about the door Anne saw that he was\\r\\nbestowing a benediction She did not wait longer but hurrying\\r\\ndownstairs followed her father into his study\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see very little of each other now father she said\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Dunnock started at her words and looked round at her with guilty\\r\\neyes\\r\\n\\r\\nYes Anne yes he murmured Do you wish to speak to me Something\\r\\nperhaps about the housekeeping and he began to fidget with his\\r\\nfingers wishing that she would go away\\r\\n\\r\\nI have wanted to speak to you for some time said Anne I have been\\r\\nthinking a great deal about my own life It will seem very selfish to\\r\\nyou and very heartless It is very selfish\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are all of us selfish said Mr Dunnock What is it that you\\r\\nwant\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to go away at least for a time said Anne I do not want to\\r\\nsettle down for the rest of my life without seeing something of the\\r\\nworld I have never been to London\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a silence and after a little she went on I shall have to\\r\\nearn my own living of course but that should not be impossible An\\r\\nexperiment  an experience  the experience would be good for me I\\r\\nhave never been to London There are so many things\\r\\n\\r\\nThat seems a very sensible plan if it can be managed said Mr\\r\\nDunnock cutting her short But then you have plenty of good sense\\r\\nAnne more than I have in some ways\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat down suddenly at his writing table dropping his head between\\r\\nhis hands and there he remained silent for so long that Anne began to\\r\\nwonder if he had forgotten her but she said nothing only repeating\\r\\nunder her breath It is settled I am leaving home\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at last Mr Dunnock looked up saying Let me see What was\\r\\nI going to say You will require some money Anne if you are going\\r\\naway I can give you twenty pounds enough to enable you to look about\\r\\nyou Do as you think best dear child in every way His head began to\\r\\nnod again and then as if suddenly waking up he said\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad you are going Anne I am glad the suggestion came from you\\r\\nthat it should be your own wish I am rather bad company I know but\\r\\nthere is a reason for that You think my life here is narrow perhaps\\r\\nbut you see only one side I can assure you that you are mistaken my\\r\\nlife is incredibly rich and overflowing with happiness But that has to\\r\\nbe hidden there is a reason for that I need loneliness you perhaps\\r\\nneed to see the world at present but we shall meet again and I have\\r\\nno fear that ultimately  you will understand what is hidden He\\r\\nbroke off disconnectedly and suddenly Anne felt her happiness shot\\r\\nthrough by a feeling of dismay in which she wondered if she could\\r\\nleave her father to fend for himself Such phrases were familiar to her\\r\\nfrom his lips but they seemed strange coming at such a moment and when\\r\\nshe went from the room it was with a conviction that she would be doing\\r\\nwrong to go away\\r\\n\\r\\nHer scruples were soon forgotten in the excitement of making plans and\\r\\nthe rest of the day was spent in packing and unpacking a wooden box\\r\\nwith her possessions Two days later all was ready and the hour of her\\r\\ndeparture had been fixed for the morrow In the morning she went to say\\r\\ngoodbye to Mrs Sotheby and to ask if Rachel would come to have tea\\r\\nwith her\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall miss you very much said Mrs Sotheby But I shall try to\\r\\nthink that you are enjoying yourself seeing more of the world than you\\r\\nwould here I hardly know what to say about Rachel You know how fond\\r\\nshe is of you She will want to come to say goodbye it is a great\\r\\npity that Mr Sotheby has arranged to take us to see the cottages at\\r\\nLinton You would not care to come with us I suppose Then everyone\\r\\nwould be happy\\r\\n\\r\\nI should like to come very much said Anne if I shall not be in the\\r\\nway\\r\\n\\r\\nIll just ask Mr Sotheby if there will be room in the dogcart for us\\r\\nall said the old woman and through the opened door into the parlour\\r\\nAnne could see the grocer sitting at the table looking up from a sheet\\r\\nof blue paper with a Tsquare in his hands\\r\\n\\r\\nThey set off soon after lunch Anne sitting on the back seat of the\\r\\ndogcart with Rachel but the pony did not seem to feel the extra\\r\\nweight Anne soon set Rachel talking and the little girl kept her\\r\\namused with stories of her school and how she had been teased about\\r\\nher brother and it was some time before she broke the news of her\\r\\nown departure Rachel stared down at the road a yellow river flowing\\r\\nso swiftly from below the dogcart that she could not distinguish the\\r\\nstones in it You wont ever think of me you wont write to me you\\r\\nwont ever come back were her thoughts but she knew that she must\\r\\nhide her unhappiness and when she spoke as the trap drew up smartly\\r\\nit was to ask Will you be going to Paris a question which Anne\\r\\nfound so disturbing that she saw little of the first cottage into which\\r\\nshe was led The smell of fresh paint mingled with the fragrance\\r\\nof aromatic pine shavings on the plank floors recalled her to her\\r\\nsurroundings and she listened for a moment to Mr Sotheby who was\\r\\nspeaking to her\\r\\n\\r\\nThese cottages are only a steppingstone to greater things Miss\\r\\nDunnock I have mortgaged them already What Linton lacks is a\\r\\nhighclass Temperance Hotel overlooking the river Such a hotel would\\r\\nattract visitors for the fishing and boating and would cater also\\r\\nfor the more respectable commercial men A Temperance Hotel would\\r\\nwake up trade in the town and would provide a delightful centre for\\r\\nholidaymakers and abstainers and men from the university\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat shall I say to Rachel Anne asked herself as she followed the\\r\\ngrocer up the little staircase into the poky bedrooms which smelt of\\r\\nvarnish\\r\\n\\r\\nA little shop like ours is a great snare for a man with ambition I\\r\\nhave wasted the best years of my life in it years during which I might\\r\\nhave built up a great merchandising house But this hotel and others\\r\\nlike it will soon make my son a rich man and provide for Rachel A\\r\\nTemperance Hotel with a grand loggia looking over the river pillars\\r\\nwith climbing roses a small winter garden with azaleas We must\\r\\nmove with the times you know Miss Dunnock\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne descended the narrow stairs and followed Mrs Sotheby across a\\r\\npatch of sticky clay to the dogcart\\r\\n\\r\\nYes I am going to Paris Dont tell anyone it is a secret she said\\r\\nto the little girl as they drove off It was only after saying this\\r\\nthat Anne looked up at the cottages seeing them for the first time\\r\\nTheir extreme ugliness and the evident signs of jerrybuilding dismayed\\r\\nher\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat will the next thing be like she asked herself remembering\\r\\nthe grocer had spoken of an hotel and expecting to see it round the\\r\\ncorner In a moment or two Mr Sotheby drew rein by the side of the\\r\\nquiet stream of the Ouse but there was no building visible only an\\r\\nempty field the site for the new hotel\\r\\n\\r\\nA lounge hall lit entirely by windows of yellow stained glass is my\\r\\nidea said Mr Sotheby It will give the effect of sunshine all\\r\\nthe year round The landingstage is to run the entire length of the\\r\\nbuilding It will be covered by a glass roof There is to be a garage\\r\\non the right and a boathouse on the left each under its own dome\\r\\nof glass thus giving symmetry to the whole There will be central\\r\\nheating a lift electric light a banqueting hall\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne gazed at the waterlogged field at the slow stream with the\\r\\nbunches of reeds and the gasworks on the opposite bank and ceased to\\r\\nlisten to Mr Sothebys words The mud and water and slime would remain\\r\\nmud and water and slime the fine old bridge with the toll house\\r\\nwhich had once been a chapel would stay there nothing would move the\\r\\ngasworks and Anne felt unable to picture to herself the glittering\\r\\nabomination of which the grocer spoke on that melancholy river bank\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr Sotheby went on talking for some time and turning her head\\r\\nAnne could see that his wife was not listening and her own attention\\r\\nsoon wandered She saw the whip being pointed first in one direction\\r\\nand then in another and the white beard which wagged as the grocer\\r\\nopened and shut his mouth but the stream of words went on unheard At\\r\\nlast Mr Sotheby picked up the reins cracked his whip and they set\\r\\noff for home Except for Rachel they had enjoyed themselves as Mrs\\r\\nSotheby had predicted\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one in Dry Coulter would have recognized the slim figure in a\\r\\nfashionable tailormade dress who took her seat in the boattrain three\\r\\ndays later When she shook her head to refuse the offer of magazines\\r\\nno hairpins flew on to the platform and the reason was explained when\\r\\nshe removed her rakish little hat Anne wore an Eton crop Her whole\\r\\ncharacter seemed to her to have changed and looking into the mirror\\r\\nin the lid of her little vanitycase she was pleased with her new\\r\\nself For a moment she fingered an unused lipstick and then laughing\\r\\nto herself deliberately reddened her lips She was off to Paris\\r\\nalone to seek her fortune Her father everyone at Dry Coulter every\\r\\nexperience she had ever had in her life seemed never to have existed\\r\\nIt was a dream which would be speedily forgotten and reaching for her\\r\\nbag Anne opened a French book of which Richard had spoken\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhere in the Weald of Kent the grinding noise of the brakes\\r\\nsuddenly applied disturbed her reading The train dragged itself to a\\r\\nhalt and a long silence followed\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last Anne threw open the window and peered into the darkness\\r\\nThere was nothing to be seen but a red light shining somewhere down\\r\\nthe line and the vague forms of oak trees near at hand For a moment\\r\\nthere was nothing to be heard and then suddenly her ear caught a\\r\\nfaroff melodious chuckle and a moment afterwards the first startling\\r\\nclear notes of a birds song The red light changed to green there was\\r\\na long puff and a series of snorts from the engine the ticking of\\r\\nreleased brakes and once more the train was in motion But Anne had\\r\\nrecognized the note of the nightingale\\r\\n\\r\\nLove she said to herself and began laughing\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTWELVE RICHARDS FRIENDS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo men and a woman were having breakfast in the studio in their\\r\\ndressinggowns\\r\\n\\r\\nOh my God Grandison exclaimed Richard Sotheby after looking into\\r\\nthe letter which Anne had posted two days before in London What am I\\r\\nto do Here is that girl arriving in Paris tomorrow She asks me to\\r\\nget her lodgings and to meet her at the station What on earth am I to\\r\\ndo I wonder if I could stop her coming She doesnt give her London\\r\\naddress No I cant stop her Oh what a curse\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison laughed and turning to the woman beside her told her the\\r\\nnews in bad French A look of incredulity passed over her brown face\\r\\nand then she also began to laugh The dark eyes sparkled with malice\\r\\nthe even white teeth shone she put the point of her healthy pink\\r\\ntongue between her painted lips and then the humour of the situation\\r\\nincreasing as she turned the news over in her mind she sprang up and\\r\\ndanced barefooted round the breakfast table in the middle of the\\r\\nimmense room The skirts of the silk dressinggown whirled round the\\r\\nlithe body every movement was lovely but neither of the men looked\\r\\nat her When she stopped it was to pour out a flood of questions which\\r\\nwent unanswered\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not a joke said Richard Sotheby gloomily You will have to\\r\\nhelp me You dont object I suppose he added in French to the girl\\r\\nif Grandison devotes his time to her\\r\\n\\r\\nHow insolent you are Richard said the woman taking hold of\\r\\nGrandisons arm and putting her cheek beside his head I am to be\\r\\nsacrificed because you cant face a woman I could call you some hard\\r\\nnames if I chose She pouted but at once went on But I wont for\\r\\nI sympathize with you Really I am anxious to see this girl of yours\\r\\nRichard It will be a curiosity Are you going to bring her to live\\r\\nwith us I shall be charming to her and she will keep me company\\r\\nsometimes Two men is more than I can manage She pouted again and\\r\\nadded in tones of deep tenderness Two dirty Englishmen\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Sotheby looked at her with a patient smile then ignoring her\\r\\nquestions he turned to his friend and said speaking in English And\\r\\ntwo women is more than I can manage\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison flushed with anger but Richard forestalled anything he might\\r\\nhave said by adding My dear you know I am fond of Ginette dont\\r\\nmisunderstand what I say But two women is more than I can put up\\r\\nwith\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy on earth will you persist in regarding Ginette as a woman\\r\\ndemanded the younger man in tones of fury Woman woman Its always\\r\\nwoman with you Ginette is Ginette just as I am Gerald and you are\\r\\nRichard\\r\\n\\r\\nSotheby did not reply and his friends angry tones soon subsided\\r\\nHarmony was restored while the breakfast dishes were cleared away\\r\\nand for the rest of the morning Annes arrival was discussed calmly\\r\\nsometimes in English sometimes in French while the two men painted\\r\\nand Ginette posed In the evening everything that had been said in the\\r\\nmorning was repeated but at last it was decided that Grandison should\\r\\nmeet Anne at the station instead of Richard and that he should take\\r\\nher to an hotel\\r\\n\\r\\nLet it be on the other side of Paris said Richard next morning as\\r\\nhe and Grandison left the studio on their way to the station for he\\r\\nhad decided to accompany his friend in order to point out the girl whom\\r\\nhe was to meet\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything in France is different Anne said to herself as she\\r\\nlooked out of the window of the train Those trees must be elms but\\r\\nthey have been shaved like French poodles so that they are scarcely\\r\\nrecognizable These are fields of corn and here are cocks and hens\\r\\nand cartsheds but they do not seem to be the real things so much as\\r\\nimitations of ours And the houses How extraordinarily different are\\r\\nthe houses for the train was passing through a station and building\\r\\nafter building flashed by her dreary houses with the stucco peeling\\r\\noff them each with its brokenslatted shutters beside the windows\\r\\nhouses such as do not exist in England\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there is any beauty in this country it is of another kind from\\r\\nour English beauty just as the ugliness is unlike our ugliness The\\r\\nchange did not dismay her it had the same effect of strangeness as the\\r\\nreflection of her own cropped head in the glass seen unexpectedly as\\r\\nshe lifted her handbag from off the luggage rack\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train was approaching Paris and before many minutes had passed a\\r\\nporter in a blue blouse had seized upon her handbag and Anne forgot to\\r\\nlook for Richard Sotheby in the effort to produce a good impression\\r\\non the porter But even the inadequacy of her French could not detain\\r\\nhim for more than a moment His moustache trembled eagerly his eye\\r\\nflashed then he had disappeared\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a lovely outline there is to his cheek how clear his\\r\\ncomplexion how expressive his every movement and looking after the\\r\\nporter she began to fancy that if all Frenchmen were as handsome as the\\r\\nporter she would be in love with them all The beauty of the French\\r\\nface she said lies in the beauty of the cheekbones An English face\\r\\nis made up of eyes and nose and mouth the rest of the face is a blank\\r\\nspace but take away a Frenchmans eyes so often like eggs or olives\\r\\ntake away his nose and his mouth always an uninteresting mouth and\\r\\nyou find his face is still full of expression and of beauty indeed the\\r\\nface is improved\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the porter was back and had set off down the platform with a\\r\\ncommanding gesture to Anne to follow him when she found herself being\\r\\naccosted by a stranger\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this Miss Dunnock My names Grandison he said Richard Sotheby\\r\\nasked me to meet you here he is not able to come himself\\r\\n\\r\\nGinette Grandisons brother Anne said to herself looking into the\\r\\nsurly boyish face and noticing Grandisons shyness Meanwhile the\\r\\nporter with the lovely cheekbones had disappeared with her suitcase\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat does the porter matter she thought What does the suitcase\\r\\nmatter What does it matter what this young man is mumbling about\\r\\nRichard No nothing matters This is Paris I have arrived and a\\r\\ndelightful happy life awaits me with these charming people The opera\\r\\n friends In such a mood it seemed scarcely surprising that Richard\\r\\nshould after all come up to them just as they were climbing into a cab\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the latest news from Dry Coulter he asked taking the seat\\r\\nbeside her Anne had not slept the channel crossing by night was too\\r\\nexciting an experience to be missed and she had remained on deck\\r\\nwatching the receding lights of England disappear and then the lights\\r\\nof France springing up out of the darkness and growing in brilliance\\r\\nand in number\\r\\n\\r\\nDry Coulter she asked and for the first moment the name conveyed\\r\\nnothing to her How can you ask about Dry Coulter when we are in\\r\\nParis Richard laughed and Anne added at once Oh I went with your\\r\\nfather and mother and Rachel to see the new cottages and the site for\\r\\nthe hotel\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat hotel asked Richard but while Anne was explaining she did\\r\\nnot notice the look of anxiety on his face for she was too much\\r\\ntaken up with looking out of the taxi window Soon she was asking\\r\\nquestions What is that building that street that monument and\\r\\nwas astonished that neither Richard nor his friend could tell her\\r\\nShe would have liked to spend hours driving about Paris feeling Mr\\r\\nGrandisons gaze fixed upon her and aware of the slight flush on her\\r\\nown cheek but suddenly they rattled over a bridge and had turned into\\r\\na narrow lane\\r\\n\\r\\nI have taken a room for you here said Richard as they drew up You\\r\\nget your breakfast in your room and an evening meal for about four\\r\\nshillings a day I took it for a week I suppose you will be staying a\\r\\nweek in Paris\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall be staying for ever answered Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison gave a short loud laugh I like the way you said that he\\r\\nexclaimed handing her suitcase out of the cab\\r\\n\\r\\nA sleepylooking man had opened the hotel door and was taking her\\r\\nluggage\\r\\n\\r\\nWell call for you this evening and take you out to dinner if that\\r\\nwould suit you said Richard and the next moment the taxi began to\\r\\nmove off and she found herself alone\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall like Mr Grandison she said as she followed the doorkeeper\\r\\nupstairs and the excitement of looking at her room was mingled with\\r\\nthe excitement of imagining that in a few days she would be laughing\\r\\nwith the handsome man who had met her and that he would lose his\\r\\nsurliness and his shyness as they walked through Paris side by side\\r\\nBy the time she had finished unpacking she felt tired and she lay\\r\\ndown on the bed to rest She could not sleep and an hour later when\\r\\nshe looked out of the window and saw that the sunlight which had\\r\\ngreeted her on her arrival had given place to driving rain She had no\\r\\numbrella nor mackintosh so she could not go out and she felt shy and\\r\\nuncomfortable as she walked through the passages of the hotel When she\\r\\ntried to speak to the chambermaid she found that she had forgotten her\\r\\nfew words of French but at last the day passed by and she was called\\r\\nfrom her room to find Mr Grandison waiting for her in the hall\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard sent me he will meet us in the restaurant he said They got\\r\\ninto a cab for it was still raining and drove in silence until Anne\\r\\nlooking out of the window asked what street they were in I dont\\r\\nknow answered the young man There are so many streets in Paris But\\r\\nit is quite easy to find ones way about\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne would have liked to ask him about his sister but she lacked the\\r\\ncourage and nothing more was said The restaurant to which they had\\r\\ndriven was like a hundred others which they had passed on the way\\r\\nand appeared indistinguishable from the restaurants on either side of\\r\\nit each with basketwork chairs heaped upside down on the little iron\\r\\ntables outside with an awning flapping in the wind and Brasserie\\r\\nwritten in gigantic letters along the front It was still raining but\\r\\nwhen they had passed through the doors they found the room was crowded\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard was waiting for them at a corner table and they sat down Soon\\r\\nfood was brought them and Richard began to speak about the restaurant\\r\\nbut Anne hardly took in his words and forgot to help herself from the\\r\\nlittle dishes for she was charmed by the scene before her the small\\r\\ntables each with its merry party men laughing hastily before filling\\r\\ntheir mouths with soup swallowing it and then laughing again as they\\r\\ntore the long rolls of bread to pieces with their fingers\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Richard was pressing Anne to help herself handing her the little\\r\\ndishes and filling her glass with yellow wine then turning and\\r\\nspeaking to Grandison about some play of Ibsens which was being acted\\r\\nat a theatre in Paris Annes pleasure was increased by knowing that\\r\\nRichard and his friend were talking of a play which she had read and\\r\\nthat she could share in the discussion if she chose but her attention\\r\\nwandered once more and she was the first to notice a girl who came\\r\\ntowards them threading her way between the tables followed by a fat\\r\\nman with a square red beard who stopped to speak to some acquaintances\\r\\nwho hailed him as he passed But the girl came on and held out a cool\\r\\nbrown hand for Anne to shake\\r\\n\\r\\nMademoiselle Lariboisièrealways called Ginette said Richard\\r\\nGinette was beautiful very beautiful and Anne wondered how the\\r\\nmistake had arisen which had made her expect Ginette to be Mr\\r\\nGrandisons sister Instead of that she was a Frenchwoman with a lean\\r\\nbrown face like a mask and dark hazel eyes with black lashes\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I were only like Ginette she thought a wish that recurred for\\r\\nmany days afterwards whenever she was in her company never guessing\\r\\nthat the French girl was saying to herself If I were only like this\\r\\nEnglish girl of Richards\\r\\n\\r\\nGinette sat down opposite them without appearing surprised that Richard\\r\\nand Gerald should go on talking in English and pay no attention to her\\r\\ninterrupting each other laughing at one moment and becoming almost\\r\\nangry in the next But though they were talking in English Anne did\\r\\nnot listen either she gazed across the table at Ginette wishing that\\r\\nshe could speak to her and get to know her At last the meal was over\\r\\nthe dishes were cleared away and soon they were joined by the fat man\\r\\nin spite of all appearances an American\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne found that he was kissing her hand and a drop of soup from his\\r\\nbeard was smeared over her fingers Her face showed her disgust as she\\r\\njumped up from her seat and without speaking to the American who had\\r\\ndrawn a chair near her she went over to Ginette But Ginette did not\\r\\nunderstand English and after one or two halting sentences Anne fell\\r\\ninto silence\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group round the table was joined by several people and each\\r\\nnewcomer shook hands all round the table before sitting down Anne\\r\\nhad never shaken hands so often in her life but there was no more\\r\\nhandkissing and there were no more beards A Chinaman seated himself\\r\\nbeside Ginette and they spoke so slowly that Anne was able to\\r\\nfollow their conversation and she was astonished that she had heard\\r\\neverything they said on the lips of English curates at tea parties\\r\\nin English parsonages After a little while Grandison came and sat\\r\\nbeside her and poured her out a glass of something warm perfumed and\\r\\nsticky it seemed the most delicious liquid that she had ever tasted\\r\\nConversation flowed on all sides of her but she sat quiet saying\\r\\nnothing and looking at the pink face and the fair hair of Richards\\r\\nfriend and then at the Chinaman who was talking so quietly and so\\r\\ntediously about the fatigues of railway journeys to Ginette both of\\r\\nthem indifferent to the shouting excited group clustered round Richard\\r\\nand the redbearded American Anne did not gather what the subject\\r\\nof their argument was and she felt no desire to do anything An hour\\r\\npassed and then another hour and once Grandison called to the waiter\\r\\nwho refilled her little glass with the liqueur It was enough for her\\r\\nto know that she was in Paris and that this was her welcome The\\r\\nvoices the faces the Chinaman and Ginette melted into a dream full\\r\\nof colour and of movement and shot through with music her head nodded\\r\\nand when Grandison touched her on the shoulder she smiled at him and\\r\\nrealized that she was very tired\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to go to bed she said Will you please tell me the address\\r\\nof my hotel\\r\\n\\r\\nIll see you home he said Richard is set now he will stay here\\r\\nfor hours\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had stopped raining and they walked The streets gleamed and they\\r\\nturned into a great open place filled with trees and people sauntering\\r\\nunder them Men in groups were talking and laughing pretty girls and\\r\\npainted women flashed their golden teeth as they passed by\\r\\n\\r\\nHow beautiful a town is Anne said almost unconscious that she was\\r\\nspeaking aloud But I shall never be at home in one The stones of the\\r\\nstreets frighten me I love the garden where\\r\\n\\r\\n  Stumbling on melons as I pass\\r\\n  Insnared with flowers I fall on grass\\r\\n  Annihilating all thats made\\r\\n  To a green thought in a green shade\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused for a moment stumbled with sleepiness and took Grandisons\\r\\narm\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd here is so thick she continued The faces search ones\\r\\nface the eyes meet ones eyes yet they all seem to be looking for\\r\\nsomeone they can never find\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked on slowly for some way in silence but at last she spoke\\r\\nagain\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe everyone here is pursuing a dream just as I pursued a dream\\r\\nwalking under the elms at home they speak to each other and pass on\\r\\nbut they never know each other Man is always alone They speak to each\\r\\nother their eyes meet and sparkle they smile and take each other\\r\\nby the arm all in a dream Here am I walking beside you both of us\\r\\nare dreaming unable to awake or to speak to each other There was\\r\\na pause Grandison did not contradict what she had said and then she\\r\\nmurmured more to herself than to him I am utterly alone but so is\\r\\neverybody else\\r\\n\\r\\nThey continued walking for a long way through deserted streets Anne\\r\\nwas feeling depressed by her train of thought and Grandison was\\r\\nsilent but when at last they reached the Rue de Beaune she felt as if\\r\\nhe had spoken and she had understood\\r\\n\\r\\nThey shook hands he looked into her eyes cleared his throat as if he\\r\\nwere going to speak swallowed something but then turned away without\\r\\na word\\r\\n\\r\\nI was wrong Anne said feeling her heart filled once more with hope\\r\\nThere is patience and nobility and honesty and faithfulness in the\\r\\nworld As she dropped asleep it seemed to her that these qualities\\r\\nwere inseparable from blue eyes and fair hair and fresh blunt\\r\\nfeatures\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRTEEN PARIS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day when she got up Anne said to herself that she must see\\r\\nRichard at once to discuss her plans with him But the beauty of the\\r\\nday tempted her to explore Paris The morning was spent happily in\\r\\nlooking into the windows of the shops in the Rue de Rivoli and in\\r\\nbuying herself an umbrella then she lunched alone thinking that\\r\\nit would be better to reach the studio in the afternoon But it was\\r\\nalready late before she found Montmartre and when at last she had\\r\\nmounted the staircase and had rung the bell she was prepared for\\r\\nRichard to be out\\r\\n\\r\\nA day wasted she said to herself but in her heart she felt that it\\r\\nhad been well spent wishing that she could spend another day and then\\r\\nanother in wandering about Paris In the evening she had dinner at her\\r\\nhotel and then went out once more to see the town by night\\r\\n\\r\\nI can never get lost in Paris so long as I can find the river for if\\r\\nI follow the river sooner or later I must come to the Pont Royal and\\r\\nfrom there it is but a step to my hotel She walked along the quays\\r\\nfor some little way but the Place de la Concorde tempted her with its\\r\\nwide expanse and presently she found herself under the trees of the\\r\\nChamps Elysées The clouds parted and the moonlight shone through the\\r\\nyoung leaves a few dark figures moved in the shadows and a band of\\r\\nyoung men passed her humming a foxtrot Anne stopped for a moment and\\r\\nwaved her arms with a sense of freedom and then strode rapidly up the\\r\\nhill\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Étoile she turned to the left down an avenue which she guessed\\r\\nwould bring her to the river and when she saw the moonlight shining\\r\\nover the water she cried aloud I am free I can do what I like I can\\r\\nlive how I like I may never see Richard or his friend or anyone I have\\r\\never met again I have no friends in the world Nobody can interfere\\r\\nnow with my happy life And suddenly as she gazed over the water\\r\\nAnne remembered how she had wept in her bedroom on the morning when\\r\\nthe ploughmen had come No need for tears now that the accursed chain\\r\\nis broken Who would guess meeting me here that I was the vicars\\r\\ndaughter with no hope of escaping from the parish I am still alone\\r\\nabsolutely alone but I care nothing for that because I am free I\\r\\nam free she repeated in a loud voice which startled her but there\\r\\nwas no one near her and she set off along the bank of the river\\r\\nI shall never go back she said drawing herself up proudly then\\r\\nlooking at the water she wished that she could bathe and her gaiety\\r\\nand irresponsibility were such that she was almost on the point of\\r\\nundressing beneath a lamppost and plunging in She recollected in time\\r\\nthat she would be saved by a French policeman and walked on laughing\\r\\nas she pictured to herself the explanations that she would offer next\\r\\nmorning in the policecourt in her broken French\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard would never forgive me if I dragged him to a policecourt\\r\\nshe said and her thoughts went back to her father Strange how blind\\r\\nI was thinking that he needed me when he welcomed my going But who\\r\\nknows he may be missing me now She turned back when she had reached\\r\\nSt Cloud and retraced her footsteps easily in less than an hour she\\r\\nhad reached the Pont Royal\\r\\n\\r\\nI have done something that no respectable girl should do she said as\\r\\nshe went up to her room I have run the risk of being spoken to in the\\r\\nstreet Apparently I am not attractive enough to be in any danger from\\r\\nthe vicious she added as she looked in the glass but she was pleased\\r\\nwith what she saw there and fell asleep at once\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a letter from Richard waiting for her asking her to luncheon\\r\\nthe following day and when the time came Anne was overjoyed to see a\\r\\nfamiliar face once more though she had been repeating to herself the\\r\\nwords she had spoken by the river\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door of the studio was opened by Ginette who held out a cool hand\\r\\nAs the girl turned to lead her in Anne looked at the dark head with\\r\\nthe short black hairs cropped close to the brown neck and such envy\\r\\nfilled her at the sight that she nearly burst into tears To be cool\\r\\nand dark and brown to live in a studio with two men to talk French\\r\\nsuch were the hopeless ambitions which filled her heart Grandison got\\r\\nup from his chair as she came in but he said nothing only bowed and\\r\\nsat down again with his eyes on her face Richard was washing his hands\\r\\nin the corner Dont come near me Anne I am covered with paint he\\r\\ncalled out but his voice sounded friendly as though he were glad to\\r\\nsee her\\r\\n\\r\\nGinette laid her hand on her shoulder\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are very beautiful she brought out laboriously She had been\\r\\npractising the phrase all the morning and the unexpected words set\\r\\nAnne blushing with pleasure Richard has said much of you but not that\\r\\nyou are beautiful He is bad\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnes blush was a blush of happiness and she caught the French girl\\r\\nby the hand and pressed it Ginette laughed and raised her eyebrows\\r\\nand would have spoken if they had not been startled by Grandison who\\r\\nordered them to sit down to luncheon\\r\\n\\r\\nI have brought some of the drawings I did for fashion plates to show\\r\\nyou said Anne but Richard did not refer to them when the meal was\\r\\nover he seemed more interested in Dry Coulter than in Paris and began\\r\\nto speak of the village while his companions sat in silence\\r\\n\\r\\nI have heard from Rachel she is very excited as she is going to\\r\\nbe chosen Queen of the May You know Mayday is even more of an\\r\\ninstitution than Plough Monday he said turning towards Grandison\\r\\nIt is celebrated more pleasantly in an English village than in Paris\\r\\nAnd Richard began to describe how five little girls were chosen of\\r\\nwhom Rachel would be the leader to go from house to house carrying an\\r\\narbour of flowers and singing whatever songs they happened to know\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arbour is made of cowslips and may with a few of the early purple\\r\\norchids said Anne calling up the memory of Mayday a year ago It\\r\\nwas raining when they came to the vicarage and they wore yellow ribbons\\r\\nand sang Ta ra ra Boom de ay I opened the door and they went on\\r\\nsinging without paying any attention to the sixpence I held out to\\r\\nthem\\r\\n\\r\\nThat sixpence went to the chapel Sunday School Treat said Richard\\r\\nPaganism has been made respectable\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat will Rachel wear as the May Queen\\r\\n\\r\\nShe speaks of a wreath of pansies if there are enough of them out to\\r\\nmake it her companions will have chaplets of forgetmenots and they\\r\\nwill carry the bower while she carries an armful of tulips She did not\\r\\nspeak of her dress but of course it will be a white one and they will\\r\\nwear black worsted stockings and solid little hobnailed boots laced\\r\\nhigh up the leg\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel doesnt worry about her boots said Anne at once and her\\r\\nthoughts flew back to Mr Yockney then she looked round the studio\\r\\nthinking that the rent was paid out of the grocers shop at home I\\r\\nthink Rachels perfectly happy I think all your family are she said\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they ought to be said Richard laughing See what a good son\\r\\nI am I give my father an object in life which is more than any of\\r\\nyou do He is very happy and proud of me In the old days of course\\r\\nRichard went on the first of May was a great affair with a maypole\\r\\nset up and a Jack of the Green The May Queen was not a little girl in\\r\\nthose days You would have been chosen instead of Rachel and having\\r\\nbeen kissed by all the boys in the village you would have got rid of\\r\\nyour obsession about never getting to know anyone\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne blushed uncomfortably and looked at Grandison who must she\\r\\nthought have repeated what she had said while he was seeing her home\\r\\nAn obsession about never getting to know anyone and she wondered if\\r\\nRichard had summed her up for ever in these unkind words\\r\\n\\r\\nI expect the maze was laid out on a Mayday said Richard and the\\r\\nmonument is nothing more than a stone maypole or something with the\\r\\nsame signification\\r\\n\\r\\nI can tell you about the monument said Anne It commemorates the\\r\\nrestoration of Charles II and was put up by a young man of nineteen\\r\\nwho must have come back from France with the King and recovered his\\r\\nsequestered estatea small enough one I should guess and the Old\\r\\nHall I suppose the maze might have been cut on a Mayday and no doubt\\r\\nthey had a maypole on the green again they had been put down under\\r\\nthe Commonwealth but I doubt if there were many to dance All the\\r\\nbetter people had served in Cromwells regiments Except in Huntingdon\\r\\nitself they were all Puritans\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we must imagine your young cavalier setting up a maypole on the\\r\\ngreen and dancing with gypsy girls and all the riffraff he could\\r\\nassemble while the village people held aloof under the elm trees round\\r\\nthe edges of the green and prayed for a thunderstorm said Richard\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were oak trees in those days not elms said Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do you know that he asked her sharply\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew positively but she had forgotten how she knew and as she\\r\\nrepeated that she was sure she felt that she must seem very stupid to\\r\\nMr Grandison\\r\\n\\r\\nWell he danced in a scarlet coat with lace ruffles which he\\r\\nhad brought back from France with the gipsy girls in their rags\\r\\nand Maggie Pattle joined in for the sake of the beer but all the\\r\\nrespectable tenants stood under the oak trees looking glum and hating\\r\\nhim But how do you explain that the monument is still standing and\\r\\nthat though it is the most striking thing in the village nobody ever\\r\\nlooks at it or knows anything about it If one asks a question they\\r\\njust shake their heads and change the conversation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young cavalier lived to be eightyeight answered Anne It is\\r\\nnatural that nobody would dare disturb his maze while he was living\\r\\nor to pull down the stone column sculptured with his arms All the\\r\\nPuritans were dead before he was and the significance of the monument\\r\\nwas forgotten by 1729\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the civil war isnt forgotten said Richard\\r\\n\\r\\nI have often heard a villager say when someone has got into trouble\\r\\nfor poaching hares We want another of the Cromwells in this country\\r\\nThere were no game laws in Nollys time\\r\\n\\r\\nI expect there is a tradition that the maze represents something out\\r\\nof harmony with the village they have ignored it for so long that they\\r\\nhave forgotten everything except that it is something which ought to be\\r\\nignored said Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard agreed with her and an hour passed before she remembered the\\r\\ndrawings she had brought to show him\\r\\n\\r\\nLeave them for me to look at said Richard but she would not be\\r\\nput off As she untied the portfolio she felt that her fingers were\\r\\ntrembling and she became confused as she explained that she knew her\\r\\ndrawings were not fashionable she had done them at Dry Coulter in\\r\\nignorance of what the latest fashions might be thinking that they\\r\\nwould serve as specimens to show her workmanship Instead of explaining\\r\\nthis clearly what she said was something very silly but Richard did\\r\\nnot smile at her absurdity and there was an absolute silence as she\\r\\nlaid the first of the drawings on the table propping it up against a\\r\\nwine bottle\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long while Richard Sotheby stood wrinkling his nose and Gerald\\r\\nand Ginette stood silent\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the next said Richard sharply but going to the portfolio\\r\\nhimself he turned over the other drawings rapidly There was a silence\\r\\nagain as he carefully fastened the clasp of the portfolio and then\\r\\nturned and walked a few steps away Suddenly however he began to\\r\\nspeak and the words fell so rapidly that Anne could scarcely follow\\r\\nthem\\r\\n\\r\\nDress designers are very stupid people he began Dont be\\r\\ndiscouraged when I advise you not to show these actual drawings\\r\\nIn order to create an impression you must first obtain a thorough\\r\\nknowledge of the mode There is just as much fashion in the drawings of\\r\\ndresses as in the dresses themselves What would have been all right\\r\\nlast year or the year before is quite out of date now And he began to\\r\\nexplain very rapidly what these changes in styles of drawing had been\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted suddenly by Ginette Anne could not follow her\\r\\nwords but she noticed Grandison nod his head vigorously and say\\r\\nAn excellent idea while an expression of exasperation came over\\r\\nRichards white face\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he turned to Anne she felt a sudden conviction that her drawings\\r\\nwere bad and that Richard was concealing his opinion of them\\r\\n\\r\\nGinette is of the opinion that you are the right figure and that you\\r\\nhave acquired Heaven knows how the right appearance for a mannequin\\r\\nShe wants to introduce you to a man she knows who works in one of the\\r\\nwholesale houses I think that you would dislike such a life and would\\r\\nsoon wish that you were back in England But dont despair about your\\r\\ndrawings he added almost shouting the last words\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne took up her portfolio turning Ginettes advice over in her mind\\r\\n\\r\\nHow should I get a job as a mannequin she asked but an argument\\r\\nhad broken out between Richard and Ginette and her question went\\r\\nfor some time unanswered At last he turned from the French girl in\\r\\nexasperation and she repeated her question\\r\\n\\r\\nGinette will let you know he said Come to tea tomorrow at five\\r\\noclock The tone of the invitation was so cross that Anne said\\r\\ngoodbye at once Grandison had scarcely spoken a word during the\\r\\ndiscussion but as she left the room he made a gesture as if he would\\r\\nspeak but he said nothing\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat have I done to upset them all so much she asked herself as\\r\\nshe hurried down the stairs but she could find no answer Richards\\r\\nwords had been encouraging yet she was tempted to tear up her wretched\\r\\ndrawings then and there\\r\\n\\r\\nYes my fashion plates are hopeless she said to herself but she\\r\\nfound it hard to understand why Richard should have been so exasperated\\r\\nby Ginettes suggestion If my drawings are no good I must find some\\r\\nother way of earning my living Richard would keep me in a fools\\r\\nparadise until my money is exhausted\\r\\n\\r\\nHer train of thought was interrupted by the sound of footsteps and she\\r\\nheard a voice calling her It was Richard\\r\\n\\r\\nI meant to ask you if you are short of money let me lend you ten\\r\\npounds You must have time to look about you\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne stared at him in surprise He was very white out of breath with\\r\\nrunning and his words came with an effort but his tone was still one\\r\\nof exasperation\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you she said looking him in the eyes Thank you I have\\r\\nstill seventeen pounds\\r\\n\\r\\nWell later on answered Richard Whenever you want a loan come\\r\\nto me While one has money it is ones duty to share it That is what\\r\\nGrandison and I believe and after all you and I come from the same\\r\\nvillage\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter saying this he turned round and walked back quietly cursing her\\r\\nexistence\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOURTEEN A REMOVAL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow could I ever have imagined that I was in love with Richard\\r\\nSotheby Anne asked herself in astonishment as she walked back across\\r\\nParis It turns out I dont love him enough to borrow money from him\\r\\nHe would always behave well he would always be kind yet I think he\\r\\nwould be delighted if he were never to see me again I shall never ask\\r\\nhim for help or for advice I shall never go near his studio after\\r\\ntomorrow And it occurred to her suddenly that the money he had\\r\\noffered to lend her had been earned by his father and that it might\\r\\nhave been spent on Rachel or on the Temperance Hotel\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder why it is that Ginette loves him she asked herself If she\\r\\nreally does If I were her I should lose my heart to Mr Grandison\\r\\nAnd saying this she recalled the look in Grandisons eyes and how he\\r\\nhad kept them fixed on her how he had seemed to be going to speak and\\r\\nthe gesture with which he had sunk back into his chair as she went out\\r\\nof the studio Richard has robbed me of knowing him We should easily\\r\\nhave become intimate we should have been friends she said with her\\r\\nheart full of bitterness Every detail of her walk with Grandison came\\r\\nback and hurt her\\r\\n\\r\\nWell I am to be a mannequin if they like my figure The more she\\r\\nthought of Ginettes suggestion the better she liked it and the more\\r\\ndifficult she found it to understand Richards annoyance She was\\r\\npuzzled to find an explanation and tried one theory after another but\\r\\nnothing she could imagine seemed to her probable and when five oclock\\r\\ncame on the following afternoon she had almost persuaded herself\\r\\nthat the explanation of Richards illhumour must be something quite\\r\\nunconnected with herself She knocked and Richard opened the door and\\r\\nstood for a moment in the threshold before admitting her He stared at\\r\\nher with a grin on his face and said Oh So it is you Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nWerent you expecting me she asked noticing his surprise You said\\r\\nI was to come to tea\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Sotheby led her into the studio and Ginette rose from the\\r\\nsofa where she had been lying The girls face had changed Anne\\r\\ncould see that she had been crying but there was so much pride in her\\r\\ngreeting that she felt shy of looking her in the face\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a letter for you said Ginette gravely speaking in French\\r\\nand pronouncing her words with the greatest distinctness You are to\\r\\npresent it personally to M Kieselyov at that address at eight oclock\\r\\ntomorrow morning If he thinks you are in the English style he will\\r\\nengage you\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you with all my heart Your goodness Ginette did not wait\\r\\nfor Anne to finish her sentence but walked away across the room\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard was making the tea Have you heard from your father he asked\\r\\n\\r\\nNo I havent said Anne feeling rather guilty She had not written\\r\\nto him since her arrival\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a letter from mother with messages for you from Rachel He was\\r\\nhalf tempted to add that their names must be coupled together in the\\r\\nvillage by now and that this was disagreeable to him but he looked at\\r\\nAnne and refrained\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had taken off her hat and the short closely cropped hair shone\\r\\nlike straw There was a worried look on her pale face\\r\\n\\r\\nMy God what innocence he said to himself\\r\\n\\r\\nGinette and Richard have been quarrelling thought Anne wondering if\\r\\nGrandison would come in for she was miserably disappointed not to see\\r\\nhim\\r\\n\\r\\nBut instead of asking if he would be back to tea she said I wonder if\\r\\nthe swallows are building again in our dove house\\r\\n\\r\\nDo they build there asked Richard and the whole expression of his\\r\\nface altered at her words\\r\\n\\r\\nYes they have a nest on the joist Father leaves the top half of the\\r\\ndoor open for them and they fly in and out They are the prettiest\\r\\nof the birds my favourites for no birds exceed them in loveliness\\r\\nof colouring the steelblue back the crimson throat and the white\\r\\nbelly The flight of the swallow is more beautiful than that of any\\r\\nother bird but this pair are prettiest when they sit side by side on\\r\\nthe rails outside the dove house Their spirits always seem to me a\\r\\nlittle low she moves one wing and then the other as though she were\\r\\nshrugging her little shoulders and then suddenly he bursts into\\r\\nsong Do you know the swallows song\\r\\n\\r\\nNo said Richard I have never heard a swallow sing He sat down\\r\\nand buried his face in his hands and repeated in tones of utter\\r\\nwretchedness No I have never heard a swallow sing\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has the clear note of a contralto not loud or defiant nor yet\\r\\nfeeble but full of love subdued because he can never forget that the\\r\\nworld is full of cruelty and unkindness\\r\\n\\r\\nGinette broke in with a question as to what Anne had said\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard told her and the French girl smiled wearily\\r\\n\\r\\nIn England it is only the swallows apparently which have discovered\\r\\nsuch platitudes Then she added Why is she staying\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears we invited her to tea answered Richard in a low voice\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was the sound of a heavy tramp on the stairs and then a knock\\r\\nRichard stood up and went to the door Anne looked across at Ginette\\r\\nand saw that she was gazing at her with a strange expression\\r\\n\\r\\nI must go she said to herself Why does she look at me as if she\\r\\nfelt contempt for me But it seemed impossible to go after that look\\r\\nwithout an explanation The memory of that expression would haunt her\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked up and saw that Richard had come back from the door and\\r\\nthat a workman had followed him and together they crossed the studio\\r\\nand disappeared into the little room at the back\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne sat and sipped her tea tortured by the need to speak to ask\\r\\na question to see light and by the desire to escape to go out of\\r\\nthe studio and never to set foot in it again But she could not find\\r\\nthe words with which to ask her question or to take her leave and\\r\\nshe sat on dumbly watching the workman crossing the room first with\\r\\na rolledup mattress in his arms and then with a little folding bed\\r\\nor carrying a washhandstand Richard came back and threw himself\\r\\ndown in a chair There was a silence prolonged until the workman\\r\\nreappeared crossed the studio and went out once more with a chair and\\r\\na lookingglass\\r\\n\\r\\nGinette gave Richard an appealing look and he said\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne I think perhaps you had better go now Ginette and I are both\\r\\nrather upset He paused for a moment and said in colourless tones\\r\\nBesides someone who wishes to see you is waiting\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne rose Goodbye Mademoiselle Lariboisière she said holding out\\r\\nher hand The brown hand gripped hers firmly\\r\\n\\r\\nTill we meet again she said and then added in broken English You\\r\\nhave a lucky face\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for telling me about the swallows said Richard as he\\r\\nstood above her at the top of the stairs\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French workman was struggling with a small table on the staircase\\r\\nand it was some moments before she could reach the street\\r\\n\\r\\nNever to know the meaning Never to learn the secret Never to\\r\\nunderstand anything at all Anne cried with tears coming into her\\r\\neyes I have never seen into another persons heart I never shall\\r\\nWherever I am my curse clings to me A vague project of suicide\\r\\nof being found floating in the river passed through her mind as she\\r\\nstepped out into the street The workman was still in front of her\\r\\nlifting the table into a small motorvan in avoiding him she ran into\\r\\nGrandisons back\\r\\n\\r\\nGood God You here Dont go away he exclaimed as though she was\\r\\nrunning from him Anne stepped back and stood for a moment staring in\\r\\nastonishment into his red face\\r\\n\\r\\nHis words sounded angry and his blue eyes glittered angrily so that\\r\\nshe felt afraid and her first impulse was to run back into the house\\r\\nI cannot go up there again flashed through her mind and she turned\\r\\nagain to Grandison\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Dunnock said the young man still looking at her almost\\r\\nmurderously I must make an explanation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word explanation caught her ears No that is impossible she\\r\\nsaid to herself for some reason An explanation is impossible\\r\\n\\r\\nI dont understand she said in a weak voice giving up all thoughts\\r\\nof flight She was almost in tears I dont understand anything\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandisons anger or passion seemed suddenly to have completely\\r\\ndisappeared He looked at her appealingly with an expression in which\\r\\nshe could read pity for her and misery on his own account For a moment\\r\\nhe tried to speak and choked and then swallowing went on rapidly\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is rather complicated I am taking away my furniture to a new room\\r\\nand must superintend the man unpacking it If you could come with me in\\r\\nthe van we could talk to each other\\r\\n\\r\\nThe van was packed the man was waiting impatient of their\\r\\nconversation Anne did not hesitate but scrambled up on to the\\r\\ntailboard of the van and settled herself on the rolledup mattress\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was excited without knowing why and suddenly looking at Grandison\\r\\nperched beside her on the edge of the washhandstand she felt happy\\r\\nand secure\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to explain he said suddenly as though he were defending\\r\\nhimself This is my furniture I am taking it away from the studio\\r\\nbecause I cannot live with Richard or with Ginette any longer I have\\r\\nbroken with them completely and have taken a room of my own\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was so much suffering in his voice that Anne understood that\\r\\nthere had been a quarrel At that moment all seemed suddenly to have\\r\\nbecome clear to her and she felt that she was a very experienced\\r\\nperson What foolishness she exclaimed to herself\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy should they have quarrelled And she decided to persuade\\r\\nGrandison to turn back\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy do you want to leave them she asked gently She was preparing\\r\\nto reason with him sympathetically and softly to lead him back to\\r\\nRichard For a moment Grandison sat silent and something in his sullen\\r\\nexpression his trembling lip and the way in which he opened and then\\r\\nshut his hand moved her very much\\r\\n\\r\\nI must explain he repeated Ever since I met you at the station I\\r\\nhave been madly in love with you\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne felt cold all over as she heard these words she shivered and\\r\\ngazed at Grandison with frightened eyes asking herself if she had\\r\\nheard what he had said aright a suspicion crossed her mind that he was\\r\\nplaying a joke on her a heartless practical joke She gazed at him in\\r\\nterror but he went on without turning his head to look at her It\\r\\nhas been awful I could not speak to you while I was still living in\\r\\nRichards studio I think Ginette guessed but Richard did not suspect\\r\\nuntil I told him after you went yesterday I did not think it would\\r\\nupset him so much or that it would upset me so much\\r\\n\\r\\nI dont understand why he should be upset or why he dislikes me but\\r\\nI feel he does There has never been anything between Richard and me\\r\\nsaid Anne She stopped feeling that she had said something foolish\\r\\n\\r\\nI know but there has been a great deal between Richard and me\\r\\nanswered Grandison Just now he hates you though it is not your fault\\r\\nthat I am in love with you and he knows that\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has got Ginette said Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nOh my God cried Grandison making the most awful face Ginette was\\r\\nmy mistress Surely you knew that\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne gazed at the cuff of Grandisons coat a check material with a\\r\\nlittle wavy thread of purple running among the fawns and greys She was\\r\\novercome with shame and confusion at her ignorance and her stupidity\\r\\nThere was a long silence\\r\\n\\r\\nThis doesnt seem like a trick she said to herself but the fear\\r\\nthat Grandison might in some way be playing some strange and terrible\\r\\njoke at her expense remained at the back of her mind\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some reason I thought that Ginette and you were the same person\\r\\nbefore I arrived she said You see I overheard Richard spelling out\\r\\na telegram to you in French before I had ever spoken to him\\r\\n\\r\\nA telegram Grandison asked in astonishment Oh yes perhaps he\\r\\ndid telegraph I wrote and told him that I was in love with Ginette\\r\\nand that I proposed taking her to live with us That was a dreadful\\r\\nthing to have done You see Richard was very fond of me he cares\\r\\nabout nobody else he said suddenly wiping the sweat off his forehead\\r\\n\\r\\nI have always all my life mismanaged my love affairs But that is\\r\\nbecause I have never been in love before Now I am in love with you\\r\\nand I determined not to mismanage that but to make a clean sweep of\\r\\neverything\\r\\n\\r\\nThis remark and the defiant tone in which it was uttered struck Anne\\r\\nas comic she laughed but immediately regretted having done so for\\r\\nGrandison burst into tears\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had never seen a man weep before and was alarmed The tears\\r\\nstreamed down his cheeks and hung on the stubble of his beard for\\r\\nhe had not shaved that day and then fell one after another on to his\\r\\nknees\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne jumped up from the mattress hitting her head on the top of the\\r\\nvan Oh Damn She clutched Grandison round the shoulders while\\r\\nher eyes filled with tears from the pain Dont cry I have hit my\\r\\nhead such an awful crack but you see I am not crying she said\\r\\nhugging him and then slipping on to her knees He looked at her and\\r\\nthe van pulled up with a jerk just as they found each others faces\\r\\nin a kiss They alighted and Grandison led the way into the meanest\\r\\nbuilding that Anne had ever seen His room was on the top floor and\\r\\nas they ascended an odour of cooking of accumulated filth of bugs\\r\\nand of boiled rags took them by the throat But they climbed on up\\r\\nand up and behind them toiled the indignant workman sweating under\\r\\nthe mattress in his arms and pausing to curse the smells and the\\r\\nfilthiness of the house under his breath\\r\\n\\r\\nThe view is magnificent said Grandison with a sweep of his arm as he\\r\\nthrew open the door of a tiny attic\\r\\n\\r\\nPut the things down anywhere just as you like he added to the\\r\\nworkman He was right the view was magnificent All Paris lay\\r\\nglittering at their feet in the sunshine and Anne forgot the\\r\\nmalodorous staircase as she leant out of the open window\\r\\n\\r\\nYes the view is lovely she said turning to Grandison but an\\r\\naltercation was going on with the workman who was repeating again and\\r\\nagain This place stinks\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison could understand the words well enough but he was offended\\r\\nand resolutely shrugged his shoulders repeating Dont understand\\r\\nFetch my furniture\\r\\n\\r\\nThis place stinks repeated the workman with appropriate gestures\\r\\nIt gives me a bad throat He made sounds as if he were going to be\\r\\nsick\\r\\n\\r\\nI dont understand what you say fetch the furniture repeated\\r\\nGrandison in a rage and began to push the man out of the room A\\r\\nhouse full of Poles and bugs said the man as he made off down the\\r\\nstaircase\\r\\n\\r\\nIts quite an accident said Grandison that there is such a\\r\\nwonderful view I took the first room I could find by candle light It\\r\\nis dirty but I had it scrubbed out with disinfectant this morning I\\r\\nshall get some sulphur candles in case what he says about the bugs is\\r\\ntrue\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne sniffed a smell of Jeyes fluid hung in the air They were silent\\r\\ngazing out of the window waiting while the slow tramp of feet and\\r\\nmuttered curses drew nearer and the man came in carrying the bed\\r\\n\\r\\nIt stinks he announced returning to Richard\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison cursed suddenly with great obscenity in fluent French\\r\\n\\r\\nYou mustnt talk to me like that answered the man but he left the\\r\\nroom after looking at Anne with an air of icy disapproval Damn the\\r\\nfellow said Grandison and they remained silent while the table the\\r\\nwashhandstand a piece of drugget and the chairs were brought in\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison had recovered his temper by then and gave the man a tip\\r\\nOne doesnt say such things said the workman pocketing it and he\\r\\nwent down the stairs clearing his throat They listened to the tramp\\r\\nof feet descending the stairs without looking at each other and stood\\r\\nmotionless through the minutes of dead silence which followed He must\\r\\nbe waiting and poking about in the hall was their unspoken thought\\r\\nand exchanging a swift glance they nodded their suspicions A sudden\\r\\ncrash resounded up the stairs of the outer door being slammed and they\\r\\nsmiled happily at each other for love is impossible except in secret\\r\\nBut although they smiled the silence continued their hearts beating\\r\\nfaster and faster and confusion coming upon them\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must put up the bed said Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison helped her mechanically the pleasure of her presence near\\r\\nhim was so great that he was afraid to speak lest some word of his\\r\\nmight scare her away Together they unfolded the legs of the narrow\\r\\niron bedstead set it upon its feet covered it with a weedy mattress\\r\\nand a coverlet Then they laid the carpet on the floor set the trunk\\r\\nin one corner the washstand in another and put the table in the\\r\\nmiddle of the room There was nothing more to be done and after\\r\\nspeaking once or twice of buying such necessaries as a broom and a\\r\\nlookingglass they became silent again Anne sitting in the only\\r\\nchair Grandison upon the bed while darkness closed in on them very\\r\\nslowly\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed to the girl then that at last she had found what she had been\\r\\nseeking\\r\\n\\r\\nI have found this room she said to herself and already she was at\\r\\nhome in it and she sat musing over the vast landscape of the future\\r\\nof which she had suddenly caught a glimpse as she had of Paris itself\\r\\nbut without knowledge and unable to recognize the landmarks\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at last rousing herself she looked about her and asked suddenly\\r\\nHow will you paint in such a small room\\r\\n\\r\\nI dont know he answered I only paint because Richard does\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has got dark she said I cant see your face\\r\\n\\r\\nHe struck a match and they looked at each other\\r\\n\\r\\nI havent got a candle he said apologetically And there is no gas\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne rose from her chair She is going Grandison said to himself\\r\\nas he stood up Their hands touched and they embraced I have always\\r\\nloved you Before I knew you Before I knew myself while I was still\\r\\nin the navy he whispered rapidly between his kisses\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whispering went on and on in the dark room lit by the flickering\\r\\narc lamps in the street below Each whisper was a charm that breathed\\r\\nlove into her that stole away her strength and that changed her\\r\\nnature Yet Anne still held herself alert danger seemed near at any\\r\\nmoment a heavy footstep might sound upon the stairs a voice break in\\r\\nIt seemed to her that if she sat very still the danger might pass and\\r\\nwhen Grandisons voice rose she stroked his hair nervouslyhair as\\r\\nshort and thick and soft as fur\\r\\n\\r\\nRichardthe danger is Richard she said to herself recognizing that\\r\\nshe was helpless in face of that danger\\r\\n\\r\\nHours passed but no footstep sounded on the stairs and no voice spoke\\r\\nout of the darkness only the moon breaking through the clouds flooded\\r\\nthe room with light showing them to each other They became hungry\\r\\nbut they forgot their hunger remembered the passage of time and as\\r\\nsoon forgot it grew sleepy and did not think of sleep\\r\\n\\r\\nA clock struck and they counted eleven strokes\\r\\n\\r\\nYou must be hungry said Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nYes I am answered Grandison surprised but he took an apple from\\r\\nhis pocket and when they had shared it their hunger seemed to be\\r\\nsatisfied\\r\\n\\r\\nA clock struck and they lost count of the strokes\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is midnight said Anne I must go back to my hotel But she did\\r\\nnot move and an hour later she had consented to stay the night had\\r\\nundressed in the dark and had got into the bed while Grandison had\\r\\nwrapped himself in his overcoat and covered with the piece of drugget\\r\\nwas stretched out upon the floor\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long while Anne went on stroking his hair and when at last they\\r\\nfell asleep he was still grasping her hand in both of his and holding\\r\\nit to his lips\\r\\n\\r\\nWhats the matter\\r\\n\\r\\nA strangled cry of Help was ringing in her ears but she understood\\r\\nthat it was her own voice that she had heard\\r\\n\\r\\nWhats the matter Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is all right she answered coming to herself but her voice was\\r\\nfull of fear and Grandison sitting up by her bed could see her\\r\\nshudder\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose it was a dream she murmured and suddenly the fear left\\r\\nher as the details of her nightmare came back and she lay in silence\\r\\npiecing them together\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was something awful about my father she said I was alone\\r\\nquite alone in the vicarage There was no furniture I went from room\\r\\nto room looking for my father but all the rooms were empty all the\\r\\nfurniture had been taken away but they had left me behind Suddenly I\\r\\nlooked out of the bedroom window my fathers bedroom for it was at\\r\\nthe front of the house and as I expected I saw a Ford van stop at the\\r\\ngate and people getting out of it Anne shuddered again violently and\\r\\nGrandison began stroking her shoulder Dont tell me if it frightens\\r\\nyou he said\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo women came first and I was frightened of them because I could\\r\\nsee that they were imbecile from the way they walked but I was more\\r\\nfrightened of the men They werent mad but I could see madness in\\r\\ntheir faces and I recognized them at once They were the Puttys who\\r\\nused to live in the Burnt Farm but it seemed to me that they were\\r\\ncoming to our house They looked from side to side with wooden faces\\r\\nand I could see that underneath their woodenness they were full of\\r\\nterror When they got to the door I could no longer see them for I\\r\\ndared not look down on their heads but I heard them unlock the door\\r\\nand knew that they had come to take possession All I could do was to\\r\\nhide and for a long while I lay holding my breath and listening as\\r\\nthey laughed and screamed and threw plates at each other downstairs\\r\\nThen I heard the man coming up the stairs in his heavy hobnail boots I\\r\\nheard him fumble at the door and I began to scream\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor creature said Grandison Who were these people\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Puttys Richards mother told me their story they lived at the\\r\\nBurnt Farm answered Anne and stopped realizing that her words could\\r\\nmean nothing to Grandison\\r\\n\\r\\nYou arent frightened any longer are you he asked and his jaws\\r\\nwere pulled apart violently in a yawn he shivered all over When he\\r\\ncould speak again he repeated You are quite sure that you arent\\r\\nfrightened any longer He leant towards her to kiss her but stopped\\r\\nfeeling another yawn upon him\\r\\n\\r\\nNo why should I be she replied and without waiting to hear what\\r\\nelse she had to say he lay down on the bare boards and was asleep\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnes fear had gone but one thing still puzzled her for though\\r\\nshe had no memory of her father in her dream she knew that it was\\r\\nterrifying because of him not because of the Puttys\\r\\n\\r\\nYes the subject of my dream was my father she repeated to herself\\r\\nwondering suddenly what she was doing in Paris and hearing a slight\\r\\nsnore she looked over the edge of the bed at the sleeping figure beside\\r\\nher\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy am I here she thought This is madness and she determined\\r\\nto get out of bed and dress and hurry away if she could do so without\\r\\nwaking her neighbour A minute passed while she waited for him to fall\\r\\nsound asleep but he stirred uneasily when she sat up in bed I must\\r\\ngive him five minutes she thought Then I shall be rested She lay\\r\\nback aware that a task awaited her which would need all her strength\\r\\nbut before two minutes had passed she began breathing gently and was\\r\\nasleep herself\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFIFTEEN HONEYMOONING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA month had passed and in the last week of their honeymoon Mr and\\r\\nMrs Grandison were staying at an hotel in Avignon The sun was already\\r\\nhot when Anne came down to breakfast after waking her husband and\\r\\nleaving him to shave and to dress The American ladies smiled at her as\\r\\nshe came into the little courtyard bidding her Good morning and\\r\\nhoping that she had passed a pleasant night\\r\\n\\r\\nA pleasant night What could she answer to them But Anne smiled\\r\\nback and then she laughed for she was happy to be alive and her\\r\\nskin tingled with pleasure as she took her seat carelessly under the\\r\\nflowering oleander A dog ran in from the street causing a diversion\\r\\nthe cat sunning herself on the cobblestones leapt on to one of the\\r\\ntables the dog yapped but he was in no mood for cats and hearing his\\r\\nmasters whistle he ran out again But watching them Anne felt as much\\r\\nexcitement as if she had never seen a cat and a dog before Her eyes\\r\\nwere still bright with interest when the waiter came up with coffee\\r\\nand he also asked if she had slept well On the tray there were two\\r\\nletters one for her and one for Monsieur\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first letters for three weeks And Anne seized hers forwarded from\\r\\nher hotel in Paris and tore it open It was from her father and ran as\\r\\nfollows\\r\\n\\r\\n                                        The Vicarage Dry Coulter\\r\\n                                                        Huntingdonshire\\r\\n\\r\\n  My dear Anne\\r\\n\\r\\n  The news of your marriage is not such a great surprise as you\\r\\n  anticipated but it is not the less welcome because I had an inkling\\r\\n  that what moved you to fly abroad was much the same as that which\\r\\n  moves the whitethroat to fly here in summer\\r\\n\\r\\n  Dear girl I write strangely removed from you and the blessing I send\\r\\n  is a more disinterested one than parents are usually in a position to\\r\\n  give My revelation has come to me late in life but I am aware that\\r\\n  it has changed me greatly so that now I find it almost impossible\\r\\n  to think of worldly things However I have packed up the old silver\\r\\n  teapot which was your mothers and have had it sent to you addressed\\r\\n  to the Paris branch of our bank at Linton for greater safety\\r\\n  You shall have the rattail spoons but one seems to be mislaid\\r\\n  Your letter was the first communication for many weeks to recall me\\r\\n  to this transient world and to that extent I must admit that your\\r\\n  marriage caused me pain But no I am wrong something else has\\r\\n  happened since you lefta sad tragedy\\r\\n\\r\\n  You will remember our little angelic visitors of the dove house\\r\\n  so faithful to one another and so happy as they chased the summer\\r\\n  flies You will recollect the pleasure he gave us with his song\\r\\n  always rather saddened whilst she brooded over her mysteries in the\\r\\n  little clay cup on the joist Old Noah had occasion to go into the\\r\\n  upper storey of the dove house and carelessly for it was nothing\\r\\n  but carelessness left the hatch open I did not notice anything for\\r\\n  several days then going up myself found the swallow dead She must\\r\\n  have flown up attracted by the light and have beaten her life out\\r\\n  on the windowpanes He poor fellow had flown away I pray that\\r\\n  neither you nor your husband should ever know his sorrow My best\\r\\n  regards to the gentleman with the beautiful name your husband\\r\\n\\r\\n                                       Your affectionate Father\\r\\n                                                        CHARLES DUNNOCK\\r\\n\\r\\n  PS It gives me peculiar pleasure to inscribe Mrs Grandison on the\\r\\n  envelope\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne smiled as she finished the letter but her heart was troubled\\r\\nnever before had her father been so intimate with hernever had he\\r\\nrevealed so much of himself Her love for him came back to her a\\r\\nsudden shock astonishing her for it was a love of which she had hardly\\r\\nsuspected the existence while at the same moment she thought He can\\r\\nafford to write to me like this now I am safely married and he is in no\\r\\ndanger of my coming back\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon her emotion passed and she looked around her with renewed\\r\\nexcitement How lovely the blue sky and the blossom of the oleander\\r\\nThe waiter was standing beside her setting out the coffeepot and the\\r\\nmilk jug the cups and saucers the two hot rolls wrapped in napkins\\r\\nand the four thin bricks of lustreless sugar She picked up her\\r\\nhusbands letter and glanced at the envelope\\r\\n\\r\\nHow happy it will make Grandison to have a friendly letter from\\r\\nRichard she thought recognizing the handwriting and she sat\\r\\nwondering if after all the letters they had written to him and the\\r\\npostcards they had sent he still remained cold and unforgiving\\r\\n\\r\\nHe loved Grandison he cared for nobody else and yet Grandison never\\r\\ngave him any happiness and never showed him any consideration I\\r\\ncannot bear to think of his feelings after they parted in anger on my\\r\\naccount But this letter must be to say that he has become reconciled\\r\\nto the marriage he would not write otherwise\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard had sent a wedding present but when they had gone to the\\r\\nstudio they found it locked and after the third or fourth fruitless\\r\\nvisit the _concierge_ had told them that he had gone away\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne looked again at the letter and saw that it bore an English stamp\\r\\nand that the postmark was Dry Coulter Richard must have gone home\\r\\nsuddenly on a surprise visit\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is strange how real Dry Coulter is to me I was unhappy while I\\r\\nwas living there yet all my memories of it are beautiful and nowhere\\r\\nelse in the world seems so real as that village Are the English elms\\r\\nmore beautiful than the olives Is the song of the blackbird as lovely\\r\\nas Fleurys flute Why do I remember every detail of my life before my\\r\\nmarriage and nothing of the things that happen to me now Nothing is\\r\\nreal to me now but Grandison my happiness in him is such that I can\\r\\nenjoy no other beauty\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Anne reminded herself how she had been with him to the opera and\\r\\nto students balls in Paris night after night but the memory of them\\r\\nwas already dim a lovely voice thrilling her for a moment a sea of\\r\\nlights a crowd of faces\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot keep my attention fixed on the stage she said to herself\\r\\nAt every moment I have to turn to glance at him to look at his blunt\\r\\nhealthy features his soft and furry hair his round head so like a\\r\\nseals or an otters thrust suddenly above the surface of the water\\r\\nAll I remember of the opera of the picture galleries and of the\\r\\ncastles which we saw yesterday is catching Grandisons eye to see\\r\\nwhether he were moved by the same things that moved meand because of\\r\\nthat I felt no emotion except about him\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed but her happiness was coloured with the regret that her\\r\\nonly opportunity of seeing so many beautiful things should have been\\r\\nduring her honeymoon\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should have been just as happy if we had stayed in that horrid room\\r\\nwith the beautiful view And Anne recalled how they had spent their\\r\\nfirst days held in a web of unrealities making declarations mumbling\\r\\naffidavits before a consul handing telegrams through wire netting and\\r\\npatiently waiting for permission to get married Days vague and as\\r\\nimpossible to remember as the waving of weeds seen through water she\\r\\nsaid But Sir John who had cut off his sons allowance while he was\\r\\nliving in Paris with Richard Sotheby had been pleased at the marriage\\r\\nand had sent a cable with his blessing and a thousand pounds from\\r\\nCeylon And dismissing the past Anne paused for a moment to wonder\\r\\nwhat their life would be like in the future Grandison had consented to\\r\\nlive in London and to take the job his father had offered him in the\\r\\ntea business\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long he is dressing she exclaimed and jumping up she ran up\\r\\nthe yellow stairs to their bedroom\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had forgotten to take Richards letter with her but it was the\\r\\nfirst thing she spoke of\\r\\n\\r\\nYouve been using my powder puff she added for his shaven cheek was\\r\\ndelicious with scent\\r\\n\\r\\nStingy Stingy If there is anything I hate its stinginess he\\r\\nexclaimed embracing her again She fought with him but was overcome\\r\\nthey laughed but their laughter changed suddenly to the seriousness of\\r\\nlovemaking\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a devil you are Anne slipping out of bed like a mouse without\\r\\nwaking me until the moment you were going down to breakfast\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is difficult to wake you she answered And I always feel a\\r\\ncriminal when I do\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are a sly hypocrite But I vowed I would not come downstairs this\\r\\nmorning until you had come up again to find me You see your tricks\\r\\ndont work\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all you know I might have gone out with the American ladies\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have stayed here all day\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are scandal enough as it is in this hotel she answered\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as we were at Dijon\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you will go down alone to breakfast naturally you cause a scandal\\r\\nPeople think something dreadful must have happened They see that you\\r\\ncare nothing for me Anne Love means nothing to you\\r\\n\\r\\nHer looks were a sufficient answer to his reproaches and he was silent\\r\\nas she seized him and bent over him\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep still she whispered Looking up Grandison could see the\\r\\nceiling of the darkened room striped with bars of light from the\\r\\nupturned slats of the shutters Outside the sunlight poured into the\\r\\ngrilling street an electric tram passed by its passage announced\\r\\nby the swishing of overhead wires and followed by the crackling of\\r\\nelectric sparks Wrapped in the weakness of love Anne and Grandison\\r\\nlay at each others mercy each tiny movement was agony to them\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep still Keep still A cry broke from their lips and then in\\r\\nthe solitude of perfect unity they fell asleep The overhead wires\\r\\nswished an electric tram lurched past the hotel on grinding wheels\\r\\nabove which the soft crackle of electricity came like the sound of a\\r\\nsilk skirt Already the American ladies had left the hotel the waiter\\r\\nin the courtyard had cleared away the cold coffee and the uneaten\\r\\nrolls the forgotten letter had been handed in at the managers office\\r\\nthe chambermaid had looked through the keyhole and had gone away to\\r\\nwash vegetables in the kitchen before either husband or wife spoke\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat time is the bus he asked girding his silk trowsers with a sash\\r\\n\\r\\nIn five minutes screamed Anne looking at the gold wrist watch that\\r\\nRichard Sotheby had given her Grandison seized his pocketbook and\\r\\ncigarettes they snatched up their Panama hats and fled down the cool\\r\\nstaircase with its smell of varnish and of glue out into the baking\\r\\nheat of the street\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no taxi to be seen and no tram\\r\\n\\r\\nRun he cried and they ran though the air came hot to the mouth and\\r\\nthe sun slashed through their silk shirts scorching their shoulders\\r\\nThey were late but the charabanc had waited for them and when\\r\\nGrandison had cried out No breakfast it waited while he rushed into\\r\\nthe station buffet and came back with a bottle of sweet champagne\\r\\na long roll of bread and a green watermelon They sat in the front\\r\\nseats and the oilcloth cushions ran with their clean sweat while they\\r\\nwere drinking champagne out of the palms of their hands and spilling it\\r\\nover their knees as the heavy car lurched and bumped on the road They\\r\\nlaughed and the melon juice ran over their chins and into their ears\\r\\nthey spoke their thoughts aloud heedless of the American ladies and the\\r\\nparty of English schoolteachers behind them and the whole charabanc\\r\\nof twenty people was united by the happiness of watching them Looking\\r\\nat the outlines of their shoulders everyone was moved to a gay\\r\\nslightly tipsy sentimentality the discomfort of a whole days jolting\\r\\nof being a schoolteacher and wearing stays or a doublebreasted\\r\\nwaistcoat and starched collars and sidewhiskers all such ills\\r\\npassed unnoticed As for the lovers they paid no attention to their\\r\\ncompanions and scarcely even looked at the sights they had come to see\\r\\nStrolling through the Roman theatre and the bullring at Arles they\\r\\nmade silly jokes about asparagus and on the way home broke into their\\r\\nfirst quarrel Anne maintaining that a cigale was a grasshopper while\\r\\nGrandison reiterated that it was a sedentary dragonfly with a beetles\\r\\nbody\\r\\n\\r\\nA letter for you Sir said the porter as they entered the hotel and\\r\\nthey looked at each other in embarrassment wondering how they could\\r\\nhave come to forget Richards letter A word from him meant so much\\r\\nto both of them But recollecting how it was that they had so nearly\\r\\nmissed the bus that morning they broke out laughing\\r\\n\\r\\nBad news said Grandison his face changing suddenly Richards\\r\\nfather the grocer has gone bankrupt The worst is that I cannot help\\r\\nfeeling I have had my share in causing it by my cursed extravagance\\r\\nRichard paid for everything for me and for Ginette As he said this\\r\\nhis face flushed scarlet\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is more likely to be the hotel said Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nYes that is what Richard says and then there is a message about your\\r\\nfather he added handing her the letter His face was still flushed\\r\\nbut the first feeling of shame had passed into one of anger with the\\r\\noutside world that threatened to break in upon his happiness\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                            Dry Coulter\\r\\n\\r\\n  Dear Seal\\r\\n\\r\\n  Why do you and Anne send me so many postcards I ask because I got\\r\\n  six yesterday very disturbing when I am doing my best to forget you\\r\\n  Let the dead bury their dead What does that mean Perhaps I have\\r\\n  got the phrase wrong but for some reason though I dont understand\\r\\n  what it means I find it expresses my feelings\\r\\n\\r\\n  So dont send me any more postcards I shall think of you and Anne\\r\\n  quite as much as you deserve and I shall want to see you directly\\r\\n  you come back to England\\r\\n\\r\\n  You ask me what I think of your compact with your father and your\\r\\n  giving up painting I have no opinion about it you must settle your\\r\\n  own affairs as you think best If you mean do I think you would have\\r\\n  been a good painter if you went on I dont But I think you might\\r\\n  have eventually done something else I mean something serious and\\r\\n  badly as I think of you I still believe you capable of something\\r\\n  better than being a teamerchant in Mincing Lane That seems to me a\\r\\n  frivolous waste of time One only has one life\\r\\n\\r\\n  I have plenty to distract me here my father has involved himself\\r\\n  in a tiresome disaster He has gone bankrupt with no assets but an\\r\\n  unfinished hotel with waterlogged foundations which would have\\r\\n  flooded every winter He has taken to his bed with a bad heart\\r\\n  attack and I have spent a hectic fortnight finding out the exact\\r\\n  position Meanwhile I have arranged for a show in Bond Street and\\r\\n  have got a commission to paint a portrait I am setting up in London\\r\\n  The only drawback is that England always gives me indigestion My\\r\\n  mother is quite unmoved by the bankruptcy\\r\\n\\r\\n  Please tell Anne that I havent seen her father but from what I can\\r\\n  hear his position is much more serious He has given up taking the\\r\\n  services in church and people think that he is definitely odd The\\r\\n  vicarage certainly looks odd he wouldnt open the door to me I\\r\\n  think Anne ought to come down as soon as possible I will do what I\\r\\n  can but I have got my hands full just now\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rachel sends her love she is a pretty creature I shall have to\\r\\n  begin to think about sending her to Newnham in a year or two There\\r\\n  I know you cant help your character a bad one any more than I can\\r\\n  help mine so dont lets think of our characters and dont send me\\r\\n  any more postcards or letters\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                      Au Revoir\\r\\n                                                                RICHARD\\r\\n\\r\\n  PS Ginette has got the job she meant for Anne as a mannequin\\r\\n  _style anglais_ She writes to me _every day_ Whose fault is that\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne crumpled the letter in her hand she did not feel shame or anger\\r\\nas her husband had done she had no irritation against the outside\\r\\nworld but only pity As she followed her husband to the stairs her\\r\\nmind was busy with plans for returning to England She thought of her\\r\\nfather of the old grocer lying in bed staring at the ceiling and of\\r\\nMrs Sotheby\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the same we were right to send Richard all those postcards he\\r\\nwould have been more unhappy without any news of us Grandison was\\r\\nstamping about the room in a rage\\r\\n\\r\\nIt means no more to me than a famine in China he said\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had better pack our things we shall have to go home tomorrow\\r\\nanswered Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the train the outside world became once more like the waving of\\r\\nweeds seen through water a series of noises smells and movements\\r\\nwhich concerned them little and they did not speak of the future until\\r\\nthey were on the boat when Anne said Lets deal with our affairs\\r\\nseparately while you are arranging with your fathers firm I will go\\r\\ndown to Dry Coulter\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandison nodded and realizing that the cliffs before him were indeed\\r\\nthose of Dover that an interview with his uncle and his elder brother\\r\\nawaited him and that his father would be back in England in a few\\r\\ndays a bitter regret seized him that he had ever seen Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nLove for this woman is ruining my life he said to himself but when\\r\\nhe turned his head and he found himself gazing into her pale fierce\\r\\nhappy face he understood that he was helpless He looked at his wifes\\r\\nshort strawcoloured hair her intense grey eyes and her slim body and\\r\\nlistening to her abrupt speech he told himself that everything else was\\r\\nunimportant\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad I didnt buy a bicycle said Anne She had been thinking\\r\\nfor a moment of the past\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSIXTEEN ANGELS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train reached Linton station at last and Anne leaped out of the\\r\\nstuffy carriage all the weariness of her long wait at Cambridge\\r\\nforgotten in the excitement of seeing again what she had so often seen\\r\\nbefore She could not hide the eagerness in her voice as she handed her\\r\\nbag to the porter asking him to give it to the carrier\\r\\n\\r\\nWell Miss are you glad to be back he asked recognizing her\\r\\n\\r\\nYes of course I am she answered and smiling with surprise she made\\r\\nher way across the market place\\r\\n\\r\\nLinton was unchanged and she was filled with joy and gratitude to the\\r\\nlittle town believing that it could never alter in the future and not\\r\\nreflecting that it was scarcely three months since she had set off with\\r\\neven greater excitement on her way to France in the belief that she\\r\\nwould never see Linton again\\r\\n\\r\\nShe walked on and turned down Bridge Street rejoicing to see the\\r\\nsigns over the shops and the faces of the shopmen who were standing in\\r\\ntheir doorways looking out for the last customers before closingall\\r\\nfamiliar things and persons On the crest of the bridge she paused and\\r\\nlooked back thinking that on the morrow she would have met Grandison\\r\\nat the station and would be walking with him through the streets of\\r\\nthe old town A lorry coming towards her filled the bridge and she\\r\\ntook shelter in one of the angles of the parapet Looking down over the\\r\\nside she watched the waters of the Ouse slipping away from the masonry\\r\\nof the piers and hoped that she would see a fish but no fish showed\\r\\nitself and when she lifted her eyes she was startled by the sight of\\r\\nan addition to the landscape the beginnings surely of Mr Sothebys\\r\\nhotel There was a huge hole excavated by the edge of the river filled\\r\\nwith muddy water a mound of blue clay an ordered pile of white glazed\\r\\nbricks a few wheelbarrows upside down a lot of drainpipes and\\r\\nnothing else\\r\\n\\r\\nSo perish all innovations Anne exclaimed and recollecting how\\r\\nthe old grocer had talked to her three months before and seeing his\\r\\ntragedy before her she began to laugh\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder if Richard laughed when he saw that hole full of water Yes\\r\\nto be sure he did for we all laugh at our parents we understand them\\r\\nso well but her thoughts turning suddenly to her own father she\\r\\nsighed in despair and walked on\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had scarcely left the bridge when she caught sight of the grocer\\r\\nhimself He was sitting bolt upright driving his fleabitten white\\r\\npony his head thrown back and his white beard sticking out in front\\r\\nof him Like a billygoat looking up to Heaven thought Anne Yet he\\r\\nis like Richard too he has the same foxy nose\\r\\n\\r\\nGood evening Mr Sotheby she called out The pony had dropped to\\r\\na walk as she spoke but the old mans eye fell stonily on her and he\\r\\nmade no answer to her greeting When he had passed Anne looked after\\r\\nhim in doubt whether she had been deliberately ignored or had not\\r\\nbeen recognized or perhaps not even heard and she saw that the old\\r\\ndogcart had been lately repainted and newly varnished on the back was\\r\\nwritten in scarlet letters\\r\\n\\r\\n  INTERNATIONAL TEA TRUST\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looks ill she thought And his illness is that his pride has\\r\\nbeen wounded He has been so virtuous and so successful all his life\\r\\nit is too bad that Grandison and Ginette and excavating a hole in a\\r\\nriver bank should have combined to ruin him She smiled as she said\\r\\nthis but her thought was broken suddenly by the reflection that her\\r\\nown father was waiting for her and that in less than an hour they would\\r\\nbe speaking together Trouble would be sure to arise between them at\\r\\nonce and each of them would behave with falsity And reluctant to come\\r\\nto her journeys end unconsciously she dropped into a slower walk\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road was long and dusty and she was glad to turn aside into the\\r\\nfootpath by the crossroads a footpath that was little frequented\\r\\nfor it was half a mile longer than the road The first field was so\\r\\nhuge that it seemed she would never cross it there was not a tree on\\r\\nwhich she could rest her eyes and nothing in it except the tussocky\\r\\ngrass underfoot and a dozen thirsty bullocks clustering round an empty\\r\\ncistern by the gate waiting for the watercart A field of ripening\\r\\nwheat lay next and she pushed her way down the narrow lane between\\r\\nthe ears unable to resist snatching at some of them The grains were\\r\\nstill full of milk yet there was something dry even in their juiciness\\r\\nwhich made her clear her throat and wish for a cup of tea Already she\\r\\ncould see the elms of Dry Coulter and she pushed on getting at last\\r\\ninto the next field where there were men at work with teams of horses\\r\\nharrowing and rolling the dusty earth\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is likely enough that these are the men and the horses that came\\r\\nto our doorstep in the snow she said and soon she had crossed to the\\r\\nfar side where a line of men bent up double were strung out across\\r\\nthe field But so big was the expanse that rollers and harrows men and\\r\\nteams of horses and this string of men dibbling were so far away that\\r\\nshe could not see their faces and felt as though she were alone\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are planting cabbages she guessed Each man leans forward\\r\\nto make a hole with the dibber in his right hand sticks in a young\\r\\nplant and treads it firm with his left heel as he passes in his stride\\r\\nforward to strike the next hole So they work all day and this will be\\r\\na vast expanse of cabbages before the winter The life of these men is\\r\\nto labour all day in the sun or in the rain in these immense fields\\r\\nalone for hour after hour with nothing to speak with but horse and\\r\\nto go back at night to sleep in a tiny room with a candle burning in\\r\\nthe closed window then to rise again with the first colour of the\\r\\ndawn That is the life that the greater number have always led yet it\\r\\nhas hardly touched our thoughts and we live on their labour drinking\\r\\nthe milk and swallowing the buttered toast thinking of anything\\r\\nrather than of how the cows are kept fat and the thistles and docks\\r\\nare spudded out to make room for the wheat for there is nothing in\\r\\nall that labour or in all those lives to interest us The labourers\\r\\nthemselves are silent about it there are few songs which take mangels\\r\\nor potatoes as their subject and when we look for poetry in the fields\\r\\nwe turn south to Italy or Greece and the goats nibbling at the vines\\r\\n\\r\\nThe footpath had been ploughed up its last traces had disappeared\\r\\nbeneath the harrow and the roller and she walked carefully among the\\r\\nyoung cabbage plants withering and grey after the long days sun They\\r\\nlooked dead but they would live\\r\\n\\r\\nThey would die in a garden unless they were shaded under flowerpots\\r\\nbut everything lives in the fields perhaps the air is purer under the\\r\\nopen sky thought Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she crossed into the next field a bird flew out of a poplar tree by\\r\\nthe stream A hawk was her first thought but it surprised her by\\r\\ncalling Cuckoo as it flew\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ought to have changed his tune a month ago In July he gets ready\\r\\nto fly in August go he must Go he must go he must she repeated\\r\\nand the sentence in her fathers letter came back into her mind in\\r\\nwhich he had compared her to a whitethroat\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed he was right for I was under the same compulsion to go as\\r\\nthe birds but my going was harder At least I fancy so though the\\r\\nyoung swallows find it a difficult business to leave England staying a\\r\\nweek or two after the old birds have gone And Anne was surprised at\\r\\nherself for thinking of the birds with pleasure in the past she had\\r\\nfound her fathers love for them so irritating\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember that I wished for a bird for my hat yet in Paris where\\r\\nI could have worn it the suggestion would have disgusted me There\\r\\nwhere I was going to the opera I was always thinking of the birds and\\r\\nthe one beautiful thing that I shall never forget is the shout of the\\r\\nbirds song with which one is woken on a March morning And how they\\r\\nsing after the rain She laughed at the contradiction in herself which\\r\\nhad made her love in Paris what had so much bored her in England\\r\\n\\r\\nYet within an hour of my meeting with my father I shall be wishing the\\r\\ncats good hunting she added smiling\\r\\n\\r\\nHow will he greet me I wondera question which had been repeated\\r\\nso often that it made her ill with apprehension\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the troubles that await me She was already at Dry Coulter\\r\\nthe elms rose up before her and when she had crossed the last field\\r\\nthe path would lead her through the churchyard and on to the green The\\r\\nlast field had been cut and the last of the hay was being carried a\\r\\nlittle boy drove a clicking horserake across her path and pulling a\\r\\nlever dropped a thin roll of the last gleanings of hay at her feet\\r\\nfarther on two women were raking up the wisps of hay into heaps and a\\r\\nboy was pitching it into a red tumbril where another boy gathered it\\r\\ninto his arms and trod it underfoot after which the old mare was led\\r\\non to the next heap\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne could see that the hard work was done that they were enjoying\\r\\nthemselves playing at haymaking clearing up what the men had left\\r\\nbehind Soon she was out of the hayfield slipping over the wall of\\r\\nthe churchyard a wall which had been worn smooth by the breeches of\\r\\ngenerations of labourers for a short cut to the footpath ran among the\\r\\ngraves beneath the limbs of the giant sycamore She had never liked\\r\\nthe tree sharing her fathers jealousy for the little church so far\\r\\novertopped by it and so overshadowed in summer If it had not been part\\r\\nof the rookery he would have had it cut down The nests were hidden now\\r\\nin the leaves and as she looked up into the tree an old fancy came\\r\\nback into her mind and she said The sycamore is like Ely Cathedral\\r\\nso cool and so airy to hop from one branch to another must be like\\r\\nsitting first on one chair and then on another the pigeons shorten\\r\\nwing and alight to rest a while before they continue their voyages\\r\\njust as the tourists come in and sit for a few moments before they\\r\\nmotor on to Cambridge or Kings Lynn\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she passed the porch she stopped with a new curiosity to read the\\r\\nnotices in the past she had so often written them herself but the\\r\\nnotice which caught her eye brought back all her apprehensions\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTICE\\r\\n\\r\\n  Owing to the continued indisposition of the vicar arrangements have\\r\\n  been made for morning service to be held every Sunday by the Reverend\\r\\n  J Grasstalk and the Reverend the Honourable F H G L à Court\\r\\n  Delariver alternately until further notice\\r\\n\\r\\n                                          F LAMBERT  \\r\\n                                          H BOTTLE    _Churchwardens_\\r\\n\\r\\nThat means that father will lose his living unless I can persuade\\r\\nhim I shall have to write to the Bishop Perhaps if he took a\\r\\nholiday Anne hurried on and her spirits rose for the worst had\\r\\nnot happened She had feared that she would find an inhibition She\\r\\nopened the lychgate and went out on to the green passing beneath the\\r\\nelms There was the little stream and there lay the old monument and\\r\\nthe maze but her thoughts of her father were dispersed by catching\\r\\nsight of a jumble of yellow derricks of caravans and steam engines on\\r\\nthe green\\r\\n\\r\\nDry Coulter feast she exclaimed in astonishment Why it must begin\\r\\ntomorrow Here are the swingboats and the roundabouts here are the\\r\\nshowmen and the gipsies She hurried forward excited and yet annoyed\\r\\nthat her homecoming had chanced to be on the eve of so momentous an\\r\\noccasion as the village feast Timed to fall between the haymaking\\r\\nand the harvest she said to herself Richard would tell me that the\\r\\nfeast is as much a pagan custom as Plough Monday or Mayday Each of\\r\\nthe villages about here has its feast and they come one after another\\r\\nin the height of summer They are feasts at which there is little\\r\\nfeasting only a roundabout and swingboats on the green but tomorrow\\r\\nthe village girls will dance and the men roll up their shirtsleeves and\\r\\ntry their strength and run in hurdle races or win coconuts or a cup\\r\\nand saucer\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the elms and the beeches the canvas booths were already\\r\\nstanding five or six men were working hard to put up the swings women\\r\\nwere carrying pails of water and the horses still in their harness\\r\\nwere roaming over the green and cropping the grass All the travelling\\r\\npeople and even their children were working hard they shouted to each\\r\\nother as they ran to and fro without sparing a glance for the groups of\\r\\nvillage children the boys following them and getting in their way the\\r\\ngirls standing and gazing or sitting close by in the grass Among one\\r\\nof the groups sitting and lying on the grass Anne recognized a friend\\r\\nas she drew nearer\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel she called and the little girl looked up at once but she\\r\\nhesitated for a moment before rising to her feet and though she came\\r\\nto meet her Anne noticed that she walked slowly where a few months\\r\\nbefore she would have run The childs shyness caused a like shyness\\r\\nin Anne herself and they stood facing each other without kissing or\\r\\nshaking hands\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you very much for the postcards you sent me Mrs Grandison\\r\\nsaid Rachel Richard gave me all the postcards you and Mr Grandison\\r\\nsent him and I have put them all in my album\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish you could have seen some of the places we went to Rachel A\\r\\ngreat river the Rhone rushes down between the vineyards and there\\r\\nare castles and wonderful old towns said Anne and for a little while\\r\\nshe chattered of what she had seen abroad but ended by saying I see\\r\\nthey are getting ready for the feast We went to a wonderful circus at\\r\\nAvignon I thought of you Rachel when I saw it Grandison won a live\\r\\npigeon as a prize for which we had no home so we let it fly from the\\r\\nbridge over the river It beat its wings and flew crazily this way and\\r\\nthat but at last it lifted itself and disappeared over the battlements\\r\\ninto the town Have you been to any circuses since we went to Linton\\r\\nFair together\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a look of defiance in the childs face and a hard note in her\\r\\nshrill voice Her face was paler than ever but dark under the eyes\\r\\n\\r\\nNo I havent been to a circus there Mrs Grandison Richard wanted\\r\\nto take me to the feast at Wet Coulter but I wouldnt go\\r\\n\\r\\nYoull enjoy the feast here tomorrow wont you\\r\\n\\r\\nYes I shall enjoy the Dry Coulter feast Mrs Grandison answered\\r\\nRachel\\r\\n\\r\\nCome part of the way home with me said Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nIll come to the edge of the green\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked for a little while in silence\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have had your hair cut Rachel Was that Richards doing\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girl blushed scarlet she hung her head and seemed on the\\r\\npoint of bursting into tears Anne cursed herself for her unfortunate\\r\\nquestion The child must have got creatures in her head I should have\\r\\nremembered the village better but she was mistaken in her thought\\r\\nfor when Rachel spoke it was to say I heard that you had your hair\\r\\ncut off Mrs Grandison\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne took off her hat Yes she said It is shorter than yours Did\\r\\nRichard tell you that Their eyes met Rachel had recovered herself\\r\\nI am going to let it grow again she said defiantly Father doesnt\\r\\nlike it short She stopped to kick a stone viciously out of her path\\r\\n\\r\\nOn hearing Mr Sotheby spoken of Anne felt strangely embarrassed and\\r\\nto turn the conversation she asked How is your mother Will you tell\\r\\nher that I am back and that I shall come round to the shop to see her\\r\\nas soon as I can\\r\\n\\r\\nMother is not in the shop now replied Rachel almost rudely\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had reached the edge of the green and the little girl stopped\\r\\nshort motionless and stubborn by the little bridge\\r\\n\\r\\nMother is never in the shop now nor am I Father is made the\\r\\nmanager and there is a man under him learning to take his place\\r\\n\\r\\nIs Richard here or in London Anne asked My husband spent a day\\r\\nlooking for him but couldnt find him\\r\\n\\r\\nRichards busy This time the rudeness in the childs voice was\\r\\nunmistakable and there was a pause whilst Anne looked down into the\\r\\npale face working with passion The little girl was trying hard to keep\\r\\nback her tears\\r\\n\\r\\nIm to go to school at Cambridge Richard says I am to get a\\r\\nscholarship to go to college\\r\\n\\r\\nCome a little farther and tell me about it said Anne\\r\\n\\r\\nRachels emotion upset her and she was tired of standing still\\r\\n\\r\\nNo I must go back now The little girl was still uneasy and shifted\\r\\nfrom foot to foot\\r\\n\\r\\nWell I daresay we shall meet tomorrow said Anne disappointed She\\r\\nwas reluctant to let Rachel go wanting to find an excuse for delaying\\r\\nher own arrival at the vicarage\\r\\n\\r\\nLets go to the feast tomorrow and ride on the roundabout together\\r\\nshe said\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel lifted a pale face and gazed at her angrily two tears ran\\r\\nunheeded down her cheeks and she answered with indignation\\r\\n\\r\\nNo you wont be stopping here long then without waiting for an\\r\\nanswer or to say goodbye she ran back on to the village green When\\r\\nshe had gone a little way she dropped into a walk and soon stopped\\r\\nShe was not in the mood to rejoin her companions watching the gipsies\\r\\nwould no longer interest her and as soon as Anne had turned the corner\\r\\nRachel slowly followed in her footsteps\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rays of the sun were horizontal and the last strip of turf by\\r\\nthe Broad Ditch was striped with the shadows of the elms the darkest\\r\\nand the most brilliant greens on the water a crowd of ducklings were\\r\\nswimming eagerly in all directions in and out of the sunlight in\\r\\nanother halfhour the dew would begin to fall and the little owls would\\r\\ncome out to hoot at the cats Anne turned to look back Behind her the\\r\\nlower branches of the elms were already in shadow their tops shone in\\r\\nthe sunlight between the trunks she could see a glimpse of the village\\r\\ngreen beyond with the yellow painted roof of a roundabout There was a\\r\\nsilence and suddenly Anne gave a long sigh a sigh of happiness\\r\\n\\r\\nI am happy now and completely at peace I was never happy here before\\r\\nbut I am now for I am free The opinion of neighbours cannot weigh\\r\\non me for my life is full and happy and satisfied Each day is rich\\r\\nand full and though summer passes it returns again There are better\\r\\nyears coming than any of the years which are past and the leaves will\\r\\nalways drop in November and spring afresh in May\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure of Rachel came into view and Anne saw the child stop\\r\\n\\r\\nWell now I must see my father she said to herself shrugging her\\r\\nshoulders a trick she had caught from Grandison then she turned\\r\\ntowards the vicarage and swinging her arms and shaking her bare head\\r\\nshe walked forward From a distance the vicarage was black against the\\r\\nsunset but as she came abreast of it she saw it clearly the old\\r\\nfamiliar building strangely like a Noahs ark with a chimney at each\\r\\nend But the moment that she glanced at it Anne stopped short The\\r\\nvicarageit had been burnt It was a ruin But the hollyhocks were\\r\\nstanding in full flower the roses on the wall were not scorchedand\\r\\nAnne could see that there had been no fire all that had happened was\\r\\nthat the windows had been taken out there was no glass there were no\\r\\nwindowsashes\\r\\n\\r\\nWire netting had been nailed across each of the downstair windows\\r\\nbut the bedroom windows were open spaces Otherwise there was little\\r\\nchange the front lawn had been mowed recently the path had been\\r\\nweeded and round the windowless house all the rosetrees were in\\r\\nbloom\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne walked slowly up the pathway noticing everything and reassured\\r\\nby a hundred little details The boxtrees had been clipped On the\\r\\ndoorstep she paused uncertain whether to try the doorhandle or to\\r\\nring the bell\\r\\n\\r\\nI will ring the bell she said to herself lifting her eyes to see if\\r\\nshe were being spied upon from upstairs Through the open windows first\\r\\none bird flew and then another a third chased it then as the bell\\r\\njangled in the hall a whole covey of sparrows flew out over her head\\r\\n\\r\\nThe windows have been taken out so that the birds may fly in The\\r\\nchange seemed to her a sensible one for her father to have made She\\r\\ncould hear the shuffling of footsteps inside and at that moment the\\r\\nthought flashed through her mind that if her fathers eccentricities\\r\\nwere become such that he could no longer be a clergyman he would make\\r\\nan admirable birdwatcher on some island sanctuary\\r\\n\\r\\nHe would live alone in a hut without seeing anyone for six months of\\r\\nthe year and he would be perfectly happy Her project filled her with\\r\\nexcitement she longed to talk of it to find out if she could put it\\r\\ninto execution\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door was flung open and her father stood before her glaring up\\r\\nat her for the floor of the house was sunk below the level of the\\r\\ngarden but he showed no sign of

had been spattered over with whitewash An unpleasant dirty\\r\\nsmell came through the door in spite of ventilation the house smelled\\r\\nlike an old hencoop\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne waited for her father to speak watching him silently while the\\r\\nanger died out of his gaze He coughed once or twice blinked his eyes\\r\\nas if very tired and said at last in a mild voice Well Anne my\\r\\ndear\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you get my letter I have come to pay you a visit father\\r\\n\\r\\nA mischievous slightly guilty expression came over Mr Dunnocks face\\r\\nand he coughed again I am afraid I didnt read it he answered I\\r\\nhardly know if I can invite you in You see I am living with the angels\\r\\nnow\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a long silence It was very sweet of you to write such a\\r\\nkind letter about my marriage said Anne at last And to send me\\r\\nMammas teapot and to tell me about the tragedy in the dove house\\r\\n\\r\\nThe swallows have come back said Mr Dunnock He spoke eagerly and\\r\\nstepping out of the house he took his daughter by the arm and led her\\r\\nround the end of the vicarage A steelblue bird circled over their\\r\\nheads and swooped into the open door of the dove house\\r\\n\\r\\nAngels said Mr Dunnock putting a finger to his lips They are\\r\\nangels\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE END\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTRANSCRIBERS NOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n
